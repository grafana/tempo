In case of equal version priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version string is 'kube-like', it will sort above non 'kube-like' version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. 'Kube-like' versions start with a 'v', then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string 'alpha' or 'beta' and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version.
