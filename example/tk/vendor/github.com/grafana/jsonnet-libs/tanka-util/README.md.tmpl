Package `tanka_util` provides jsonnet tooling that works well with
[Grafana Tanka](https://tanka.dev) features. This package implements
[Helm](https://tanka.dev/helm) and [Kustomize](https://tanka.dev/helm) 
support for Grafana Tanka.

### Usage

> **Warning:** [Functionality required](#internals) by this library is still
> experimental and may break.

The [`helm.template`](#fn-helmtemplate) function converts a Helm Chart into a
Jsonnet object to be consumed by tools like Tanka. Similarly the
[`kustomize.build`](#fn-kustomizebuild) function expands Kustomizations.

Helm Charts are required to be available on the local file system and are
resolved relative to the file that calls `helm.template`.

Kustomizations are also resolved relative to the file that calls
`kustomize.build`. 

```jsonnet
%s
```

For more information on that see https://tanka.dev/helm

### Internals

The functionality of `helm.template` is based on the `helm template` command.
Because Jsonnet does not support executing arbitrary command for [good
reasons](https://jsonnet.org/ref/language.html#independence-from-the-environment-hermeticity),
a different way was required.

To work around this, [Tanka](https://tanka.dev) instead binds special
functionality into Jsonnet that provides `helm template`.

This however means this library and all libraries using this library are not
compatible with `google/go-jsonnet` or `google/jsonnet`.

Kustomize is build so that each kustomization can pull another kustomization
from the internet. Due to this feature it is not feasible to ensure hermetic and
reprodicible kustomize builds from within Tanka. Beware of that when using the
Kustomize functionality.
