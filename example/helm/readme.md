## Helm

Congratulations!  You have successfully found the Helm examples.  These examples are meant for
advanced users looking to deploy Tempo in a microservices pattern.  If you are just getting started
might I recommend the [docker-compose examples](../docker-compose).  The docker-compose examples also are much
better at demonstrating trace discovery flows using Loki and other tools.

If you're convinced this is the place for you then keep reading!

### Initial Steps
To test the Helm example locally requires:

- k3d > v3.2.0
- helm > v3.0.0

Create a cluster

```console
k3d cluster create tempo --api-port 6443 --port "3000:80@loadbalancer"
```

Next either deploy the microservices or the single binary.

### Microservices
The microservices deploy of Tempo is fault tolerant, high volume, independently scalable.

> Note: double check you're applying to your local k3d before running this!

```console
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

Install Tempo, Grafana and synthetic-load-generator

```console
helm upgrade -f microservices-tempo-values.yaml --install tempo grafana/tempo-distributed
helm upgrade -f microservices-grafana-values.yaml --install grafana grafana/grafana
kubectl create -f microservices-extras.yaml
```

### Single Binary
The Tempo single binary configuration is currently setup to store traces locally on disk, but can easily be configured to
store them in an S3 or GCS bucket.  See configuration docs or some of the other examples for help.

> Note: double check you're applying to your local k3d before running this!

```console
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

Install Tempo, Grafand and synthetic-load-generator

```console
helm upgrade --install tempo grafana/tempo
helm upgrade -f single-binary-grafana-values.yaml --install grafana grafana/grafana
kubectl create -f single-binary-extras.yaml
```

### View a trace
After the applications are running check the load generators logs

```console
# you can find the exact pod name using `kubectl get pods`
kubectl logs synthetic-load-generator-???
```
```

Extract a trace id and view it in Grafana at http://localhost:3000/explore

### Clean up

```console
k3d cluster delete tempo
```
