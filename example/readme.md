# Example

## Build images

Run the following from the project root folder to build `tempo:latest` and `tempo-query:latest` images
that will be used in the test environment:

```console
make docker-images
```

Note: `make docker-tempo` command needs to be run every time there are changes to the codebase.

## Docker Compose

```
cd docker-compose
docker-compose up
```
- Tempo
  - http://localhost:3100
- Tempo-Query
  - http://localhost:16686
- Grafana
  - http://localhost:3000
- Prometheus
  - http://localhost:9090

### Find Traces

The synthetic-load-generator is now printing out trace ids it's flushing into Tempo.  Logs are in the form

`Emitted traceId 27896d4ea9c8429d for service frontend route /cart`

Copy and paste the trace id into tempo-query to retrieve it from Tempo.

## Jsonnet/Tanka

The Jsonnet is meant to be applied to with (tanka)[https://github.com/grafana/tanka].  To test the jsonnet locally requires:

- k3d > v1.6.0
- tanka > v0.8.0

```
cd tk
k3d create --name tempo \
           --publish 16686:80

export KUBECONFIG="$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='tempo')"

# double check you're applying to your local k3d before running this!
#   deployment_type can be single-binary or microservices
tk apply <deployment_type>
```

After the applications are running check the load generators logs

```
kc logs synthetic-load-generator-75bfc5d545-xz5rz
...
20/03/03 21:30:01 INFO ScheduledTraceGenerator: Emitted traceId e9f4add3ac7c7115 for service frontend route /product
20/03/03 21:30:01 INFO ScheduledTraceGenerator: Emitted traceId 3890ea9c4d7fab00 for service frontend route /cart
20/03/03 21:30:01 INFO ScheduledTraceGenerator: Emitted traceId c36fc5169bf0693d for service frontend route /cart

20/03/03 21:30:02 INFO ScheduledTraceGenerator: Emitted traceId 23a09a0efd0d1ef0 for service frontend route /cart
```

Extract a trace id and view it in your browser at `http://localhost:16686/trace/<traceid>`

Clean up:
```
k3d delete --name tempo
```

### tempo-single-binary
The tempo single binary configuration is currently setup to store traces locally on disk, but can easily be configured to 
store them in an S3 or GCS bucket.  See configuration docs or some of the other examples for help.
