Receives data via gRPC or HTTP using [OpenCensus]( https://opencensus.io/)
format.

## Getting Started

All that is required to enable the OpenCensus receiver is to include it in the
receiver definitions.

```yaml
receivers:
  opencensus:
```

The following settings are configurable:

- `endpoint` (default = 0.0.0.0:55678): host:port to which the receiver is
  going to receive data. The valid syntax is described at
  https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md.

## Advanced Configuration

Several helper files are leveraged to provide additional capabilities automatically:

- [gRPC settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configgrpc/README.md) including CORS
- [TLS and mTLS settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md)
- [Queuing, retry and timeout settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md)

## Writing with HTTP/JSON

The OpenCensus receiver can receive trace export calls via HTTP/JSON in
addition to gRPC. The HTTP/JSON address is the same as gRPC as the protocol is
recognized and processed accordingly.

To write traces with HTTP/JSON, `POST` to `[address]/v1/trace`. The JSON message
format parallels the gRPC protobuf format, see this
[OpenApi spec for it](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-proto/blob/master/gen-openapi/opencensus/proto/agent/trace/v1/trace_service.swagger.json).

The HTTP/JSON endpoint can also optionally configure
[CORS](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-protocol), which is enabled by
specifying a list of allowed CORS origins in the `cors_allowed_origins` field:

```yaml
receivers:
  opencensus:
    cors_allowed_origins:
    - http://test.com
    # Origins can have wildcards with *, use * by itself to match any origin.
    - https://*.example.com
```
