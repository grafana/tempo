  error_mode:
    description: ErrorMode determines how the processor reacts to errors that occur while processing an OTTL condition. Valid values are `ignore` and `propagate`. `ignore` means the processor ignores errors returned by conditions and continues on to the next condition. This is the recommended mode. `propagate` means the processor returns the error up the pipeline.  This will result in the payload being dropped from the collector. The default value is `propagate`.
