The filterprocessor allows dropping spans, span events, metrics, datapoints, and logs from the collector.

## Configuration

The filterprocessor utilizes the [OpenTelemetry Transformation Language](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/ottl/README.md)
to create conditions that determine when telemetry should be dropped.
If **any** condition is met, the telemetry is dropped (each condition is ORed together).
Each configuration option corresponds with a different type of telemetry and OTTL Context.
See the table below for details on each context and the fields it exposes.

| Config              | OTTL Context                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `traces.span`       | [Span](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/ottl/contexts/ottlspan/README.md)           |
| `traces.spanevent`  | [SpanEvent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/ottl/contexts/ottlspanevent/README.md) |
| `metrics.metric`    | [Metric](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/ottl/contexts/ottlmetric/README.md)       |
| `metrics.datapoint` | [DataPoint](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/ottl/contexts/ottldatapoint/README.md) |
| `logs.log_record`   | [Log](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/ottl/contexts/ottllog/README.md)             |

The OTTL allows the use of `and`, `or`, and `()` in conditions.
See [OTTL Boolean Expressions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/ottl/README.md#boolean-expressions) for more details.

For conditions that apply to the same signal, such as spans and span events, if the "higher" level telemetry matches a condition and is dropped, the "lower" level condition will not be checked.
This means that if a span is dropped but a span event condition was defined, the span event condition will not be checked for that span.
The same relationship applies to metrics and datapoints.

If all span events for a span are dropped, the span will be left intact.
If all datapoints for a metric are dropped, the metric will also be dropped.

The filter processor also allows configuring an optional field, `error_mode`, which will determine how the processor reacts to errors that occur while processing an OTTL condition.

| error_mode            | description                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ignore                | The processor ignores errors returned by conditions and continues on to the next condition.  This is the recommended mode. |
| propagate             | The processor returns the error up the pipeline.  This will result in the payload being dropped from the collector.        |

If not specified, `propagate` will be used.

### Examples

```yaml
processors:
  filter/ottl:
    error_mode: ignore
    traces:
      span:
        - 'attributes["container.name"] == "app_container_1"'
        - 'resource.attributes["host.name"] == "localhost"'
        - 'name == "app_3"'
      spanevent:
        - 'attributes["grpc"] == true'
        - 'IsMatch(name, ".*grpc.*")'
    metrics:
      metric:
          - 'name == "my.metric" and resource.attributes["my_label"] == "abc123"'
          - 'type == METRIC_DATA_TYPE_HISTOGRAM'
      datapoint:
          - 'metric.type == METRIC_DATA_TYPE_SUMMARY'
          - 'resource.attributes["service.name"] == "my_service_name"'
    logs:
      log_record:
        - 'IsMatch(body, ".*password.*")'
        - 'severity_number < SEVERITY_NUMBER_WARN'
```

#### Dropping non-HTTP spans
```yaml
processors:
  filter/httponly:
    error_mode: ignore
    traces:
      span:
        - attributes["http.request.method"] == nil
```

#### Dropping HTTP spans
```yaml
processors:
  filter/drophttp:
    error_mode: ignore
    traces:
      span:
        - attributes["http.request.method"] != nil
```

#### Dropping metrics with invalid type
```yaml
processors:
  filter/dropempty:
    error_mode: ignore
    metrics:
      metric:
        - type == METRIC_DATA_TYPE_NONE
```


### OTTL Functions

The filter processor has access to all [OTTL Converter functions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs#converters)

In addition, the processor defines a few of its own functions:

**Metrics only functions**
- [HasAttrKeyOnDatapoint](#HasAttrKeyOnDatapoint)
- [HasAttrOnDatapoint](#HasAttrOnDatapoint)

#### HasAttrKeyOnDatapoint

`HasAttrKeyOnDatapoint(key)`

Returns `true` if the given key appears in the attribute map of any datapoint on a metric.
`key` must be a string.

Examples:

- `HasAttrKeyOnDatapoint("http.method")`

#### HasAttrOnDatapoint

`HasAttrOnDatapoint(key, value)`

Returns `true` if the given key and value appears in the attribute map of any datapoint on a metric.
`key` and `value` must both be strings.

Examples:

- `HasAttrOnDatapoint("http.method", "GET")`

## Alternative Config Options

All the following configurations can be expressed using OTTL configuration
and may eventually be deprecated as part of [#18642](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/18642).

The filter processor can be configured to include or exclude:

- Logs, based on resource attributes using the `strict` or `regexp` match types
- Metrics based on metric name in the case of the `strict` or `regexp` match types,
  or based on other metric attributes in the case of the `expr` match type.
  Please refer to [config.go](./config.go) for the config spec.
- Spans based on span names and resource attributes, all with full regex support

It takes a pipeline type, of which `logs` `metrics`, and `traces` are supported, followed
by an action:

- `include`: Any names NOT matching filters are excluded from remainder of pipeline
- `exclude`: Any names matching filters are excluded from remainder of pipeline

For the actions the following parameters are required:

For logs:

- `match_type`: `strict`|`regexp`
- `resource_attributes`: ResourceAttributes defines a list of possible resource
  attributes to match logs against.
  A match occurs if any resource attribute matches all expressions in this given list.
- `record_attributes`: RecordAttributes defines a list of possible record
  attributes to match logs against.
  A match occurs if any record attribute matches all expressions in this given list.
- `severity_texts`: SeverityTexts defines a list of possible severity texts to match the logs against.
  A match occurs if the record matches any expression in this given list.
- `bodies`: Bodies defines a list of possible log bodies to match the logs against.
  A match occurs if the record matches any expression in this given list.
- `severity_number`: SeverityNumber defines how to match a record based on its SeverityNumber.
  The following can be configured for matching a log record's SeverityNumber:
  - `min`: Min defines the minimum severity with which a log record should match.
    e.g. if this is "WARN", all log records with "WARN" severity and above (WARN[2-4], ERROR[2-4], FATAL[2-4]) are matched.
    The list of valid severities that may be used for this option can be found [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md#displaying-severity). You may use either the numerical "SeverityNumber" or the "Short Name"
  - `match_undefined`: MatchUndefinedSeverity defines whether to match logs with undefined severity or not when using the `min_severity` matching option.
    By default, this is `false`.

For metrics:

- `match_type`: `strict`|`regexp`|`expr`
- `metric_names`: (only for a `match_type` of `strict` or `regexp`) list of strings
  or re2 regex patterns
- `expressions`: (only for a `match_type` of `expr`) list of `expr` expressions
  (see "Using an `expr` match_type" below)
- `resource_attributes`: ResourceAttributes defines a list of possible resource
  attributes to match metrics against.
  A match occurs if any resource attribute matches all expressions in this given list.

This processor uses [re2 regex][re2_regex] for regex syntax.

[re2_regex]: https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax

More details can be found at [include/exclude metrics](../attributesprocessor/README.md#includeexclude-filtering).

Examples:

```yaml
processors:
  filter/1:
    metrics:
      include:
        match_type: regexp
        metric_names:
          - prefix/.*
          - prefix_.*
        resource_attributes:
          - key: container.name
            value: app_container_1
      exclude:
        match_type: strict
        metric_names:
          - hello_world
          - hello/world
  filter/2:
    logs:
      include:
        match_type: strict
        resource_attributes:
          - key: host.name
            value: just_this_one_hostname
  filter/regexp:
    logs:
      include:
        match_type: regexp
        resource_attributes:

            value: prefix.*
  filter/regexp_record:
    logs:
      include:
        match_type: regexp
        record_attributes:
          - key: record_attr
            value: prefix_.*
  # Filter on severity text field
  filter/severity_text:
    logs:
      include:
        match_type: regexp
        severity_texts:
        - INFO[2-4]?
        - WARN[2-4]?
        - ERROR[2-4]?
  # Filter out logs below INFO (no DEBUG or TRACE level logs),
  # retaining logs with undefined severity
  filter/severity_number:
    logs:
      include:
        severity_number:
          min: "INFO"
          match_undefined: true
  filter/bodies:
    logs:
      include:
        match_type: regexp
        bodies:
        - ^IMPORTANT RECORD
```

Refer to the config files in [testdata](./testdata) for detailed
examples on using the processor.

### Using an "expr" match_type

In addition to matching metric names with the `strict` or `regexp` match types, the filter processor
supports matching entire `Metric`s using the [expr](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr) expression engine.

The `expr` filter evaluates the supplied boolean expressions _per datapoint_ on a metric, and returns a result
for the entire metric. If any datapoint evaluates to true then the entire metric evaluates to true, otherwise
false.

Made available to the expression environment are the following:

* `MetricName`
    a variable containing the current Metric's name
* `MetricType`
    a variable containing the current Metric's type: "Gauge", "Sum", "Histogram", "ExponentialHistogram" or "Summary".
* `Label(name)`
    a function that takes a label name string as an argument and returns a string: the value of a label with that
    name if one exists, or ""
* `HasLabel(name)`
    a function that takes a label name string as an argument and returns a boolean: true if the datapoint has a label
    with that name, false otherwise

Example:

```yaml
processors:
  filter/1:
    metrics:
      exclude:
        match_type: expr
        expressions:
        - MetricName == "my.metric" && Label("my_label") == "abc123"
        - MetricType == "Histogram"
```

The above config will filter out any Metric that both has the name "my.metric" and has at least one datapoint
with a label of 'my_label="abc123"'.

### Support for multiple expressions

As with `strict` and `regexp`, multiple `expr` expressions are allowed.

For example, the following two filters have the same effect: they filter out metrics named "system.cpu.time" and
"system.disk.io". 

```yaml
processors:
  filter/expr:
    metrics:
      exclude:
        match_type: expr
        expressions:
          - MetricName == "system.cpu.time"
          - MetricName == "system.disk.io"
  filter/strict:
    metrics:
      exclude:
        match_type: strict
        metric_names:
          - system.cpu.time
          - system.disk.io
```

The expressions are effectively ORed per datapoint. So for the above `expr` configuration, given a datapoint, if its
parent Metric's name is "system.cpu.time" or "system.disk.io" then there's a match. The conditions are tested against
all the datapoints in a Metric until there's a match, in which case the entire Metric is considered a match, and in
the above example the Metric will be excluded. If after testing all the datapoints in a Metric against all the
expressions there isn't a match, the entire Metric is considered to be not matching.


### Filter metrics using resource attributes
In addition to the names, metrics can be filtered using resource attributes. `resource_attributes` takes a list of resource attributes to filter metrics against. 

Following example will include only the metrics coming from `app_container_1` (the value for `container.name` resource attribute is `app_container_1`). 

```yaml
processors:
  filter/resource_attributes_include:
    metrics:
      include:
        match_type: strict
        metric_names:
          - hello_world
          - hello/world
        resource_attributes:
          - key: container.name
            value: app_container_1
```

Following example will exclude all the metrics coming from `app_container_1` (the value for `container.name` resource attribute is `app_container_1`). 

```yaml
processors:
  filter/resource_attributes_exclude:
    metrics:
      exclude:
        match_type: strict
        metric_names:
          - hello_world
          - hello/world
        resource_attributes:
          - key: container.name
            value: app_container_1
```

We can also use `regexp` to filter metrics using resource attributes. Following example will include only the metrics coming from `app_container_1` or `app_container_2` (the value for `container.name` resource attribute is either `app_container_1` or `app_container_2`). 

```yaml
processors:
  filter/resource_attributes_regexp:
    metrics:
      exclude:
        match_type: regexp
        metric_names:
          - hello_world
          - hello/world
        resource_attributes:
          - key: container.name
            value: (app_container_1|app_container_1)
```

In case the no metric names are provided, `matric_names` being empty, the filtering is only done at resource level.

### Filter Spans from Traces

* This pipeline is able to drop spans and whole traces 
* Note: If this drops a parent span, it does not search out it's children leading to a missing Span in your trace visualization

See the documentation in the [attribute processor](../attributesprocessor/README.md) for syntax

For spans, one of Services, SpanNames, Attributes, Resources or Libraries must be specified with a
non-empty value for a valid configuration.

```yaml
processors:
  filter/spans:
    spans:
      include:
        match_type: strict
        services:
          - app_3
      exclude:
        match_type: regexp
        services:
          - app_1
          - app_2
        span_names:
          - hello_world
          - hello/world
        attributes:
          - key: container.name
            value: (app_container_1|app_container_2)
        libraries:
          - name: opentelemetry
            version: 0.0-beta
        resources:
          - key: container.host
            value: (localhost|127.0.0.1)
```

## Warnings

In general, understand your data before using the filter processor.

- When using the filterprocessor make sure you understand the look of your incoming data and test the configuration thoroughly. In general, use as specific a configuration as possible to lower the risk of the wrong data being dropped.
- [Orphaned Telemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/standard-warnings.md#orphaned-telemetry): The processor allows dropping spans. Dropping a span may lead to orphaned spans if the dropped span is a parent. Dropping a span may lead to orphaned logs if the log references the dropped span.
