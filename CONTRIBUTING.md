## Dependency management is weird.  Please read!

We use [Go modules](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more) to manage dependencies on external packages.
This requires a working Go environment with version 1.15 or greater and git installed.

To add or update a new dependency, use the `go get` command:

```bash
# Pick the latest tagged release.
go get example.com/some/module/pkg

# Pick a specific version.
go get example.com/some/module/pkg@vX.Y.Z
```

When updating dependencies it is important not to run the standard go modules commands due to the way that
OpenTelemetry protos have been vendored.  For now, after making dependency changes run

```bash
make vendor-dependencies
```

We are hoping to improve this in the future.

## Coding Standards

### go imports
imports should follow `std libs`, `externals libs` and `local packages` format

Example
```
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto"
	"github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go"

	"github.com/grafana/tempo/modules/overrides"
	"github.com/grafana/tempo/pkg/validation"
)

```
