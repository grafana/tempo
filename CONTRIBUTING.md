# Contributing

Tempo uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests:

- If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request.
- If you plan to do something more involved, discuss your ideas on the relevant GitHub issue.

## Dependency management

We use [Go modules](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more) to manage dependencies on external packages.
This requires a working Go environment with version 1.16 or greater and git installed.

To add or update a new dependency, use the `go get` command:

```bash
# Pick the latest tagged release.
go get example.com/some/module/pkg

# Pick a specific version.
go get example.com/some/module/pkg@vX.Y.Z
```

Before submitting please run the following to verify that all dependencies and proto defintions are consistent.

```bash
make vendor-check
```

## Coding Standards

### go imports
imports should follow `std libs`, `externals libs` and `local packages` format

Example
```
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto"
	"github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go"

	"github.com/grafana/tempo/modules/overrides"
	"github.com/grafana/tempo/pkg/validation"
)

```

## Documentation

Tempo uses a CI action to sync documentation to the [Grafana website](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest). The CI is
triggered on every merge to master in the `docs` subfolder.

To get a preview of the documentation locally, run `make docs` from the root folder of the Tempo repository. This uses
the `grafana/docs` image which internally uses Hugo to generate the static site.

> Note that `make docs` uses a lot of memory and so if its crashing make sure to increase the memory allocated to Docker
and try again.
