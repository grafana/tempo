// coalesceConditions reduces the amount of data pulled from the backend when the same column is used in multiple conditions
//
//	todo: There is a lot that can be done with this method. for example we can coalesce conditions if they have equivalent
//	operands. consider a query like: { span.foo >= 1 } && { span.foo = 1 } the conditions could be coalesced to only
//	the >= condition. it also is currently ignoring situations where allconditions is true, but some of these
//	improvements apply to that case as well.

// coalesce takes two conditions and turns them into one. it returns a bool to indicate
// if the returned condition is valid or if it should just continue using the original 2 conditions
//
// it is very difficult to coalesce conditions in a way that will always be more performant at the fetch layer
// consider: { resource.service.name = "foo" || resource.service.name = "bar" }
// if foo and bar are rare then it will be faster to double pull the column and intersect the results. if
// foo and bar are common then it will be faster to single pull the column and allow the engine to do the work.
// currently the fetch layer does not support the = condition with multiple operands. we should add capability
// and then extend this method.
//
// therefore! we will only coalesce conditions in the following cases:
//   - they are exactly the same
//   - they will pull every span anyway. example: { span.foo = "bar" } >> { span.foo != "bar" }
