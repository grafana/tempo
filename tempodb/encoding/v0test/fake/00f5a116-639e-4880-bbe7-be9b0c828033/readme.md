# v0 block

This block was created manually using the original v0 block code.  It is vaguely expected for v0 code to drift over time
as bug fixes are introduced, changes are made for v1, or the backend code changes.  This block and the associated tests
will increase confidence that these changes do not impact our ability to read a v0 block.
