# Caddy Mixin

The Caddy Mixin is a set of configurable, reusable, and extensible 
dashboards.

To use them, you need to have `mixtool` and `jsonnetfmt` installed. If you
have a working Go development environment, it's easiest to run the following:
```bash
$ go get github.com/monitoring-mixins/mixtool/cmd/mixtool
$ go get github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnetfmt
```

You can then build the Prometheus rules files `alerts.yaml` and
`rules.yaml` and a directory `dashboard_out` with the JSON dashboard files
for Grafana:
```bash
$ make build
```
