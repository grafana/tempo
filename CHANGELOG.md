## master / unreleased
* [CHANGE] Fixed ingester latency spikes on read [#461](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/461)
* [CHANGE] Ingester cut blocks based on size instead of trace count.  Replace ingester `traces_per_block` setting with `max_block_bytes`. This is a **breaking change**. [#474](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/issues/474)
* [CHANGE] Refactor cache section in tempodb. This is a **breaking change** b/c the cache config section has changed. [#485](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/485)
* [FEATURE] Added block compression.  This is a **breaking change** b/c some configuration fields moved. [#504](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/504)
* [ENHANCEMENT] Serve config at the "/config" endpoint. [#446](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/446)
* [ENHANCEMENT] Switch blocklist polling and retention to different concurrency mechanism, add configuration options. [#475](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/issues/475)
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add S3 options region and forcepathstyle [#431](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/issues/431)
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add exhaustive search to combine traces from all blocks in the backend. [#489](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/489)
* [BUGFIX] Upgrade cortex dependency to 1.6 to address issue with forgetting ring membership [#442](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/442)
* [BUGFIX] No longer raise the `tempodb_blocklist_poll_errors_total` metric if a block doesn't have meta or compacted meta. [#481](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/481)

## v0.5.0

* [CHANGE] Redo tempo-cli with basic command structure and improvements [#385](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/385)
