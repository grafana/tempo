## v1.0.1

* [BUGFIX] Guard against negative dataLength [#763](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/763) (@joe-elliott)

## v1.0.0

* [CHANGE] Mark `-auth.enabled` as deprecated. New flag is `-multitenancy.enabled` and is set to false by default.
  This is a **breaking change** if you were relying on auth/multitenancy being enabled by default. [#646](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/646)
* [ENHANCEMENT] Performance: Improve Ingester Record Insertion. [#681](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/681)

  This change requires a specific rollout process to prevent dropped spans. First, rollout everything except distributors. After all ingesters have updated
  you can then rollout distributors to the latest version. This is due to changes in the communication between ingesters <-> distributors.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow setting the bloom filter shard size with support dynamic shard count.[#644](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/644)
* [ENHANCEMENT] GCS SDK update v1.12.0 => v.15.0, ReadAllWithEstimate used in GCS/S3 backends. [#693](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/693)
