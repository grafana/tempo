<!-- local blocks processor, Azure storage, and metrics-generator with Helm charts-->

By default, the metrics-generator doesn't require a backend connection unless you've enabled the `local_blocks` processor.
The `local_blocks` processor is used for generating metrics from traces, which is required for TraceQL metrics
When this configuration is set, the metrics-generator produces blocks and flushes them into a backend storage.

In this case, list the generator in the `env var` expansion configuration so the `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY` has the secret value.

You can use this configuration example with Helm charts, like `tempo-distributed`.
Replace any values in all caps with the values for your deployment.

```yaml
generator:
  extraArgs:
    - "-config.expand-env=true"
  extraEnv:
    - name: <STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY>
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: <TEMPO-TRACES-STG-KEY>
          key: <TEMPO-TRACES-KEY>
```
