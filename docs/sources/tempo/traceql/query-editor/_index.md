# Write TraceQL queries in Grafana

The Tempo data source's query editor helps you query and display traces from Tempo in [Explore](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/explore/).
The queries use [TraceQL](/docs/tempo/latest/traceql), the query language designed specifically for tracing.

For general documentation on querying data sources in Grafana, refer to [Query and transform data](/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/panels-visualizations/query-transform-data/).

## Before you begin

You can compose TraceQL queries in Grafana and Grafana Cloud using **Explore** and a Tempo data source.

## Choose a query editing mode

The query editor has three modes, or **Query types**, that you can use to explore your tracing data.
You can use these modes by themselves or in combination to create building blocks to generate custom queries.

The three **Query types** are:

- The **Search** query builder provides a user interface for building a TraceQL query.
- The **TraceQL** query editor lets you write your own TraceQL query with assistance from autocomplete.
- The **Service Graph** view displays a visual relationship between services. Refer to the [Service graph view](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/<TEMPO_VERSION>/metrics-generator/service-graph-view/) documentation for more information.

### Search query builder

The Search query builder provides drop-down lists and text fields to help you write a query.
The query builder is ideal for people who aren't familiar with or want to learn TraceQL.

Refer to the [Search using the TraceQL query builder documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/datasources/tempo/query-editor/traceql-search/) to learn more about creating queries using convenient drop-down menus.

### TraceQL query editor

The TraceQL query editor lets you search by trace ID and write TraceQL queries using autocomplete.

Refer to the [TraceQL query editor documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/datasources/tempo/query-editor/traceql-editor/) to learn more about constructing queries using a code-editor-like experience.

You can also search for a Trace ID by entering a trace ID into the query field.

### Service graph view

Grafanaâ€™s service graph view uses metrics to display span request rates, error rates, and durations, as well as service graphs.
Once the requirements are set up, this pre-configured view is immediately available.

Using the service graph view, you can:

- Discover spans which are consistently erroring and the rates at which they occur
- Get an overview of the overall rate of span calls throughout your services
- Determine how long the slowest queries in your service take to complete
- Examine all traces that contain spans of particular interest based on rate, error, and duration values (RED signals)

For more information about the service graph, refer to [Service graph view](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/<TEMPO_VERSION>/metrics-generator/service-graph-view/).

## Use TraceQL panels in dashboards

To add TraceQL panels to your dashboard, refer to the [Traces panel documentation](/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/panels-visualizations/visualizations/traces/).

To learn more about Grafana dashboards, refer to the [Use dashboards documentation](/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/dashboards/use-dashboards/).
