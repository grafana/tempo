# Quick start for Tempo

The Tempo repository provides [multiple examples](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/tree/main/example/docker-compose) to help you quickly get started using Tempo and distributed tracing data.

Every example has a `docker-compose.yaml` manifest that includes all of the options needed to explore trace data in Grafana, including resource configuration and trace data generation.

The Tempo examples running with Docker using docker-compose include a version of Tempo and a storage configuration suitable for testing or development.

## Before you begin

To follow this guide, you need:

- Git
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- The Docker Compose plugin (included with Docker Desktop)

{{< admonition type="tip" >}}
Alternatively, you can try out this example in our interactive learning environment: [Quick start for Tempo](https://killercoda.com/grafana-labs/course/tempo/quick-start).

It's a fully configured environment with all the dependencies installed.

Provide feedback, report bugs, and raise issues in the [Grafana Killercoda repository](https://github.com/grafana/killercoda).

A setup script is running in the background to install the necessary dependencies. This should take no longer than 30 seconds. Your instance will be ready to use once you `Setup complete. You may now begin the tutorial`.

## Clone the Tempo repository and start Docker

This quick start guide uses the `local` example running Tempo as a single binary (monolithic). Any data is stored locally in the `tempo-data` folder.
To learn more, read the [local storage example README](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/example/docker-compose/local).

1. Clone the Tempo repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grafana/tempo.git
   ```

1. Go into the examples directory:
   ```bash
   cd tempo/example/docker-compose/local
   ```

1. Create a new directory to store data:
   ```bash
   mkdir tempo-data
   ```

1. Start the services defined in the docker-compose file:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

1. Verify that the services are running:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

   You should see something like:
   ```console
   docker compose ps
   NAME                 COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
   local-grafana-1      "/run.sh"                grafana             running             0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
   local-k6-tracing-1   "/k6-tracing run /ex…"   k6-tracing          running
   local-prometheus-1   "/bin/prometheus --c…"   prometheus          running             0.0.0.0:9090->9090/tcp
   local-tempo-1        "/tempo -config.file…"   tempo               running             0.0.0.0:3200->3200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:4317-4318->4317-4318/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9411->9411/tcp, 0.0.0.0:14268->14268/tcp
   ```

## Explore the traces in Grafana

As part of the Docker Compose manifest, Grafana is now accessible on port 3000.
You can use Grafana to explore the traces generated by the k6-tracing service.

1. Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

1. Once logged in, navigate to the **Explore** page, select the **Tempo** data source and select the **Search** tab. Select **Run query** to list the recent traces stored in Tempo. Select one to view the trace diagram:

   {{< figure align="center" src="/media/docs/grafana/data-sources/tempo/query-editor/tempo-ds-builder-span-details-v11.png" alt="Use the query builder to explore tracing data in Grafana" >}}


1. A couple of minutes after Tempo starts, select the **Service graph** tab for the Tempo data source in the **Explore** page. Select **Run query** to view a service graph, generated by Tempo’s metrics-generator.

   {{< figure align="center" src="/media/docs/grafana/data-sources/tempo/query-editor/tempo-ds-query-service-graph.png" alt="Service graph sample" >}}

1. To stop the services:
    ```bash
    docker compose down -v
    ```

## Traces Drilldown plugin

 The [Traces Drilldown](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/simplified-exploration/traces/) plugin offers an opinionated non query-based approach to exploring traces. Let's take a look at some of its key features and panels.

1. Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/a/grafana-exploretraces-app](http://localhost:3000/a/grafana-exploretraces-app).
2. Within the filter bar, there is a dropdown menu set to **Rate** of **Full traces**. Change this to **Duration** and **All spans**.

This updated panel view looks like this:

{{< figure align="center" src="/media/docs/tempo/explore-spans-error-view.png" alt="Traces Drilldown panel" >}}

Breakdown of the view:
* The histogram at the top shows the distribution of span durations. The lighter the color, the more spans in that duration bucket. In this example, most spans fall within `537ms`, which is considered the average duration for the system.
* The high peaks in the histogram indicate spans that are taking longer than the average (As high as `2.15s`). These are likely to be the spans that are causing performance issues. You can investigate further to identify the root cause.

Select `Slow traces` tab in the navigation bar to view the slowest traces in the system.

{{< figure align="center" src="/media/docs/tempo/slow-trace-view.png" alt="Slow traces panel" >}}

`shop-backend` appears to be the primary culprit for the slow traces. This happens when a user initiates the `article-to-cart` operation. From here, you can select the **Trace Name** to open the **Trace View** panel.

{{< figure align="center" src="/media/docs/tempo/slow-trace-trace-view.png" alt="Trace View panel" >}}

The **Trace View** panel provides a detailed view of the trace. The panel is divided into three sections:
* The top section shows the trace ID, duration, and the service that generated the trace.
* The middle section shows the trace timeline. Each span is represented as a horizontal bar. The color of the bar represents the span's status. The width of the bar represents the duration of the span.
* The bottom section shows the details of the selected span. This includes the span name, duration, and tags.

Drilling into the `shop-backend` span, you can see that the `place-articles` operation has an exception event tied to it. This is likely the root cause of the slow trace.

{{< figure align="center" src="/media/docs/tempo/slow-trace-root-cause-2.png" alt="Span View panel" >}}

## Next steps

You have successfully set up Tempo and Grafana to explore traces generated by the k6-tracing service.

### Alternative: Complete MLTP example

If you would like to use a demo with multiple telemetry signals, then try the [Introduction to Metrics, Logs, Traces, and Profiling in Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/intro-to-mlt).
`Intro-to-mltp` provides a self-contained environment for learning about Mimir, Loki, Tempo, Pyroscope, and Grafana.
The project includes detailed explanations of each component and annotated configurations for a single-instance deployment.
Data from `intro-to-mltp` can also be pushed to Grafana Cloud.
