# Quick start for Tempo

The Tempo repository provides [multiple examples](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/tree/main/example/docker-compose) to help you quickly get started using Tempo and distributed tracing data.

Every example has a `docker-compose.yaml` manifest that includes all of the options needed to explore trace data in Grafana, including resource configuration and trace data generation.

The Tempo examples running with Docker using docker-compose include a version of Tempo and a storage configuration suitable for testing or development.

## Before you begin

To follow this guide, you need:

- Git
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- The Docker Compose plugin (included with Docker Desktop)

{{< admonition type="tip" >}}
Alternatively, you can try out this example in our interactive learning environment: [Quick start for Tempo](https://killercoda.com/grafana-labs/course/tempo/quick-start).

It's a fully configured environment with all the dependencies installed.

Provide feedback, report bugs, and raise issues in the [Grafana Killercoda repository](https://github.com/grafana/killercoda).

A setup script is running in the background to install the necessary dependencies. This should take no longer than 30 seconds. Your instance will be ready to use once you `Setup complete. You may now begin the tutorial`.

## Clone the Tempo repository and start Docker

This quick start guide uses the `local` example running Tempo as a single binary (monolithic). Any data is stored locally in the `tempo-data` folder.
To learn more, read the [local storage example README](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/example/docker-compose/local).

1. Clone the Tempo repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grafana/tempo.git
   ```

1. Go into the examples directory:
   ```bash
   cd tempo/example/docker-compose/local
   ```

1. Start the services defined in the docker-compose file:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

1. Verify that the services are running:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ``` 
   
   You should see something like:
   ```console
   docker compose ps
   NAME                 COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
   local-grafana-1      "/run.sh"                grafana             running             0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
   local-k6-tracing-1   "/k6-tracing run /ex…"   k6-tracing          running
   local-prometheus-1   "/bin/prometheus --c…"   prometheus          running             0.0.0.0:9090->9090/tcp
   local-tempo-1        "/tempo -config.file…"   tempo               running             0.0.0.0:3200->3200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:4317-4318->4317-4318/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9411->9411/tcp, 0.0.0.0:14268->14268/tcp
   ```

## Explore the traces in Grafana

As part of the Docker Compose manifest, Grafana is now accessible on port 3000. 
You can use Grafana to explore the traces generated by the k6-tracing service.

1. Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

1. Once logged in, navigate to the **Explore** page, select the **Tempo** data source and select the **Search** tab. Select **Run query** to list the recent traces stored in Tempo. Select one to view the trace diagram:

1. A couple of minutes after Tempo starts, select the **Service graph** tab for the Tempo data source in the **Explore** page. Select **Run query** to view a service graph, generated by Tempo’s metrics-generator.

   {{< figure align="center" src="/media/docs/grafana/data-sources/tempo/query-editor/tempo-ds-query-service-graph.png" alt="Service graph sample" >}}

1. To stop the services:
    ```bash
    docker compose down -v
    ```

## Next steps

You have successfully set up Tempo and Grafana to explore traces generated by the k6-tracing service.

### Alternative: Complete MLTP example

If you would like to use a demo with multiple telemetry signals, then try the [Introduction to Metrics, Logs, Traces, and Profiling in Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/intro-to-mlt).
`Intro-to-mltp` provides a self-contained environment for learning about Mimir, Loki, Tempo, Pyroscope, and Grafana.
The project includes detailed explanations of each component and annotated configurations for a single-instance deployment.
Data from `intro-to-mltp` can also be pushed to Grafana Cloud.
