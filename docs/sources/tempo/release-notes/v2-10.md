# Version 2.10 release notes

<!-- vale Grafana.We = NO -->
<!-- vale Grafana.GoogleWill = NO -->
<!-- vale Grafana.Timeless = NO -->
<!-- vale Grafana.Parentheses = NO -->

The Tempo team is pleased to announce the release of Tempo 2.10.

This release gives you:

- New TraceQL features including minInt/maxInt constants and support for attribute = nil queries
- Enhanced metrics generator capabilities with entity-based limiting and overflow series
- Performance improvements and bug fixes across the platform
- Continued development of vParquet5 encoding format

These release notes highlight the most important features and bug fixes. For a complete list, refer to the [Tempo changelog](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/releases).

### TraceQL

Using new TraceQL capabilities, you can find traces with missing attributes, find traces with a specific number of children, and use integer constants for numeric comparisons.

**Attribute = nil support**: TraceQL now supports checking if attributes are nil using `attribute = nil` syntax, enabling queries for traces with missing attributes. [[PR 4905](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/4905), [documentation](/docs/tempo/<TEMPO_VERSION>/traceql/construct-traceql-queries/#comparison-operators)].

**span:childCount intrinsic**: New TraceQL intrinsic `span:childCount` which is the number of direct children of the span. Supported in vParquet5 and later. [[PR 6126](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6126), [documentation](/docs/tempo/<TEMPO_VERSION>/traceql/construct-traceql-queries/#find-spans-by-child-count)].

**minInt/maxInt constants**: Added `minInt` and `maxInt` constants to TraceQL for representing minimum and maximum integer values without hardcoding long numeric literals. Example: `{ span.http.status_code > minInt }`. [[PR 5982](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5982)]

These updates expand TraceQL’s expressiveness for numeric bounds, missing attributes, and span structure without additional preprocessing.

### Metrics-generator

Featured updates for the metrics-generator:

- **Entity-based limiting**: Added entity-based limiting mode as an alternative to series-based limiting, providing more flexible resource management. [[PR 5788](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5788)]
- **Overflow series**: Metrics generator now produces overflow series with the label `metric_overflow="true"` to capture new data once limits are hit, ensuring no data is lost. [[PR 5954](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5954)]
- **Active series demand estimate**: Added `tempo_metrics_generator_registry_active_series_demand_estimate` metric that estimates metrics-generator active series demand even when the active series limit is reached. [[PR 5710](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5710)]

Other metrics-generator improvements:

- Drop and metric invalid utf8 for all metrics in metrics generator instead of sending invalid data. [[PR 5980](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5980)]
- Add `database_name_attributes` configuration to the service graph processor to support the new `db.namespace` attribute. [[PR 5398](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5398)]
- Enhanced observability of collection failures in the metrics generator with better error categorization. [[PR 5936](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5936)]
- Added validation for metrics-generator histogram buckets to prevent invalid configurations. [[PR 5991](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5991)]
- Added configuration to enable instance label for span metrics series, improving observability. [[PR 5706](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5706)]

### vParquet5

vParquet5 continues to evolve with new preview versions and improvements:

- Added array support for dedicated columns. [[PR 5760](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5760)]
- Added virtual span row numbers. [[PR 5943](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5943)]
- Added dedicated columns for events and improved support for high-cardinality/high-length "blob" attributes. [[PR 5946](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5946)]
- Replaced well-known attributes with dedicated column defaults. [[PR 5696](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5696)]
- Added integer attribute analysis to the tempo-cli `analyse block(s)` commands. [[PR 6103](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6103)]
- Support for TraceQL intrinsic, `span:chldCount,` in vParquet5 [[PR 6126](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6126)]

#### Additional vParquet updates

- Converted `ServiceStats` data from map to list and updated encoding and compression to enable sorted output and small reduction in file size. [[PR 6216](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6216)]
- Fixed issue with orphaned group nodes in vParquet5-preview6. [[PR 6095](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6095)]
- Fixed issues related to integer dedicated columns in vParquet5-preview2: [[PR 5716](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5716)]
- Fixed disappearing dedicated event attributes in trace view and dedicated blob column validation in vParquet5-preview6. [[PR 6100](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6100)]
- Fixed dedicated column array handling to better support attributes with mixed array and non-array values. [[PR 6199](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6199)]

### LLM capabilities

- **LLM response format**: Added support for `Accept: application/vnd.grafana.llm` header to Tempo endpoints to improve MCP (Model Context Protocol) responses. Currently supported by trace by id and tag values endpoints. [[PR 5962](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5962)] This response format is subject to change and intended for LLM consumption only.

## Upgrade considerations

When [upgrading](/docs/tempo/<TEMPO_VERSION>/set-up-for-tracing/setup-tempo/upgrade/) to Tempo 2.10, be aware of these considerations and breaking changes.

### Busybox removed from Tempo image

- Remove busybox from Tempo image to make it more minimal and prevent future vulnerabilities. [[PR 5717](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5717)]

### vParquet format changes

- In the last release vParquet2 was deprecated and blocked from writes. Now, it's
  removed entirely. It will no longer be recognized as a valid encoding and cannot read any remaining vParquet2 blocks. Installations
  running with historical defaults should not require any changes as the default has been migrated for several releases. Installations
  with storage settings pinned to vParquet2 must run a previous release configured for vParquet3 or higher until all existing vParquet2 blocks
  have expired and been deleted from the backend, or else it will encounter read errors after upgrading to this release.
  vP3 will be marked as deprecated in 2.10.
- TempoDB schemas vParquet3 and v2 are deprecated and will be removed in 3.0. [[PR 6198](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6198)]

* **vParquet2 removal**: vParquet2 encoding has been completely removed. It will no longer be recognized as a valid encoding and cannot read any remaining vParquet2 blocks. Installations running with historical defaults should not require any changes as the default has been migrated for several releases. Installations with storage settings pinned to vParquet2 must run a previous release configured for vParquet3 or higher until all existing vParquet2 blocks have expired and been deleted from the backend, or else they will encounter read errors after upgrading. [[PR 6071](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6071)]

### Breaking changes

- **Tenant ID validation**: Tenant ID validation is now enforced in frontend and distributor. Invalid tenant IDs will be rejected. [[PR 5786](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5786)]
- **SearchTagsV2WithRange API change**: Added `scope` and `query` parameters to the Tempo HTTP client `SearchTagsV2WithRange` function. This is a breaking change for code using this function.

### Go version upgrade

Tempo 2.10 upgrades to Go 1.25.5, which may affect custom builds or deployments with specific Go version requirements. (PRs [#5939](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5939) [#6001](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6001), [#6096](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6096), [#6089](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6089))

If you’re building Tempo from source or using custom Docker images, ensure your build environment supports Go 1.25.5.

## Project Rhythm: New Tempo architecture

Project Rhythm is the codename for the new architecture project for Tempo. The main objective of this project is to address certain trade-offs of the current design that are limiting the ability of Tempo to grow and support new functionalities.

The goals of this project are to:

- Eliminate the requirement for replication factor 3 (RF3) -> Support high availability and improve reliability of TraceQL metrics
- Decouple the read and write path -> Scalability and reliability
- Lay out the foundation to significantly reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) -> Room for growth

Project Rhythm has been discussed in the Tempo Community Calls for several months. Refer to the [Tempo Community Calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdYwfspTOjc&list=PLDGkOdUX1Ujqe8WZ8T1h2pNjpll0t-KLw&index=4) on YouTube to learn more.

While the new architecture is available in Tempo, it is still considered experimental.

In preparation for Tempo 3.0, make sure you’re using vParquet4 or better.
