# Version 1.5 release notes

The Tempo team is pleased to announce the release of Tempo 1.5.

With this release, Tempo adds experimental support for a new trace storage format based on [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), anonymous usage reporting to help the Tempo team understand how Tempo is used, and enhancements to the metrics-generator.

We encourage users to upgrade to [Grafana 9.1](/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v9-1/) to take advantage of new Tempo-powered capabilities,
such as the [service graph view](../../metrics-generator/service-graph-view/) which visualizes span metrics (traces data for rates, error rates, and durations (RED)) and service graphs.

>**Note**: For a complete list of changes and enhancements, refer to the [Tempo 1.5 changelog](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/releases).


## Features and enhancements

Version 1.5 contains the following features and enhancements.

### Apache Parquet block format support

Tempo now supports a columnar block format for trace storage based on [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/).
We're excited about this new format because it will enable increased speed and efficiency for Tempo search. It also allows users to leverage the large ecosystem of existing Parquet tools and libraries to process and transform their trace data.

We're releasing the Parquet block format as experimental in Tempo 1.5, with plans to move it to stable in a future release once we've had more opportunity to test it.

The new Parquet block format can be used as a drop-in replacement for Tempo's existing block format.
No data conversion or upgrade process is necessary.
As soon as the Parquet format is enabled, Tempo starts writing data in that format, leaving existing data as-is.
For more information, refer to the [Parquet documentation](../../configuration/parquet/).
Please note, however, that enabling the Parquet block format means Tempo will require more CPU and memory resources than it previously did.

To use Parquet, set the block format option to `vParquet` in the configuration file.
Refer to the [Parquet documentation](../../configuration/parquet/) and the [Configuration documentation](../../configuration/#storage).

```yaml
# block format version. options: v2, vParquet
[version: <string> | default = v2]
```

For more information about the Parquet implementation, refer to the [Parquet design document](https://github.com/mdisibio/tempo/blob/design-proposal-parquet/docs/design-proposals/2022-04%20Parquet.md) and [Issue 1480](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/issues/1480).

### Metrics-generator enhancements

The [metrics-generator](../../metrics-generator/) now includes databases and requests across messaging systems in service graph metrics.
The OpenTelemetry semantic conventions are used to detect when a span is involved in one of these systems. [PR 1576](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1576)

In addition, metrics-generator supports per-tenant processor configuration. [PR 1434](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1434)

### Anonymous usage reporting

By default, Tempo reports anonymous usage data about itself to Grafana Labs. This data is used to understand which features are commonly enabled, as well as which deployment modes, replication factors, and compression levels are most popular, etc.

By providing information on how people use Tempo, usage reporting helps the Tempo team decide where to focus their development and documentation efforts. No private information is collected, and all reports are completely anonymous.

Reporting is controlled by the `usage_report` configuration option and can be disabled. For instructions, refer to [the Configuration documentation](../../configuration/#usage-report). [PR 1465](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1481)

## Upgrade considerations

When upgrading to Tempo v1.5, be aware of these breaking changes:

- [PR 1478](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1478) To build advanced visualization features into Grafana, we have decided to change our spanmetric names to match OpenTelemetry (OTel) conventions. Any functionality added to Grafana will work whether you use Tempo, Grafana Agent, or the OTel Collector to generate metrics.
   The old histogram metric name in Tempo 1.4.x:
   ```
   traces_spanmetrics_duration_seconds_{sum,count,bucket}
   ```
   has been replaced with this new name in Tempo 1.5:
   ```
   traces_spanmetrics_latency_{sum,count,bucket}
   ```
   Additionally, the default label `span_status` has been renamed to `status_code`.

- [PR 1556](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1556) Jsonnet users will need to specify ephemeral storage requests and limits for the metrics generator.
   ```
    _config+:: {
      metrics_generator+: {
        ephemeral_storage_request_size: '10Gi',
        ephemeral_storage_limit_size: '11Gi',
      },
    }
   ```

- [PR 1481](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1481) As a result of the anonymous usage reporting feature, distributors and metrics-generators now require the same level of access to object storage as compactors and ingesters. Users who disable anonymous usage reporting are exempt from this requirement.

- [PR 1558](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1558) Deprecated metrics `tempodb_(gcs|s3|azure)_request_duration_seconds` have been removed in favor of `tempodb_backend_request_duration_seconds`. These metrics have been deprecated since v1.1.

## Bug fixes

- [PR 1548](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1548) Fixed wal check on span name to be substring.

- [Issue 1258](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/issues/1258) Prevented the ingester panic "cannot grow buffer".

- [PR 1554](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1554) metrics-generator: do not remove `x-scope-orgid header` in single tenant modus.

- [PR 1589](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1589) Fixed an issue where backend does not support `root.name` and `root.service.name`.
