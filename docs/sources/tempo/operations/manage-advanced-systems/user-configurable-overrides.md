# User-configurable overrides

User-configurable overrides in Tempo let you change overrides for your tenant using an API.
Instead of modifying a file or Kubernetes `configmap`, you (and other services relying on Tempo) can use this API to
modify the overrides directly.

## Architecture

User-configurable overrides are stored in an object store bucket managed by Tempo.

![user-configurable-overrides-architecture.png](/media/docs/tempo/user-configurable-overrides-architecture.png)

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
We recommend using a different bucket for overrides and traces storage, but they can share a bucket if needed.
When sharing a bucket, make sure any lifecycle rules are scoped correctly to not remove data of user-configurable
overrides module.
{{< /admonition >}}

Overrides of every tenant are stored at `/{tenant name}/overrides.json`:

```
overrides/
├── 1/
│   └── overrides.json
└── 2/
    └── overrides.json
```

Tempo regularly polls this bucket and keeps a copy of the limits in-memory. When requesting the overrides for a tenant,
the overrides module:

1. Checks this override is set in the user-configurable overrides, if so return that value.
2. Checks if this override is set in the runtime configuration (`configmap`), if so return that value.
3. Returns the default value.

### Supported fields

User-configurable overrides are designed to be a subset of the runtime overrides. Refer
to [Overrides](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/<TEMPO_VERSION>/configuration/#overrides) for information about all
overrides.
When you set a field in both the user-configurable overrides and the runtime overrides, the value from the
user-configurable overrides takes priority.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Note that `processors` is an exception. Tempo merges values from both user-configurable overrides and runtime overrides
into a single list.
{{< /admonition >}}

```yaml
[forwarders: <list of strings>]

metrics_generator:

  [processors: <list of strings>]
  [collection_interval: <duration>]
  [disable_collection: <bool> | default = false]

  processor:

    service_graphs:
      [histogram_buckets: <list of float>]
      [dimensions: <list of string>]
      [peer_attributes: <list of string>]
      [enable_client_server_prefix: <bool>]
      [enable_messaging_system_latency_histogram: <bool>]

    span_metrics:
      [histogram_buckets: <list of float>]
      [dimensions: <list of string>]
      [intrinsic_dimensions: <map string to bool>]
      [filter_policies: [
        [
          include/exclude:
            match_type: <string> # options: strict, regexp
            attributes:
              - key: <string>
                value: <any>
        ]
      ]
      [enable_target_info: <bool>]
      [target_info_excluded_dimensions: <list of string>]

    host_info:
      [metric_name: <string>]
      [host_identifiers: <list of string>]
```

## API

All API requests are handled on the `/api/overrides` endpoint. The module supports `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`
requests.

This endpoint is tenant-specific. If Tempo is run in multitenant mode, all requests should have an appropriate
`X-Scope-OrgID` header.

If the tenant is run in distributed mode, only the query-frontend will accept API requests.

### Operations

#### GET /api/overrides

Returns the current overrides and it's version.

Query-parameters:

- `scope`: whether to return overrides from the API only `api` or merge it with the runtime overrides `merged`. Defaults
  to `api`.

Example:

```shell
curl -X GET -v -H "X-Scope-OrgID: 3" http://localhost:3100/tempo/api/overrides\?scope=merged
```

#### POST /api/overrides

Update the overrides with the given payload. Note this overwrites any existing overrides.

Example:

```shell
curl -X POST -v -H "X-Scope-OrgID: 3" -H "If-Match: 1697726795401423" http://localhost:3100/api/overrides --data "{}"
```

#### PATCH /api/overrides

Update the existing overrides by patching it with the payload.
It follows the JSON merge patch protocol ([RFC 7386](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386)).

Example:

```shell
curl -X PATCH -v -H "X-Scope-OrgID: 3" http://localhost:3100/api/overrides --data "{\"forwarders\":null}"
```

#### DELETE /api/overrides

Delete the existing overrides.

Example:

```shell
curl -X DELETE -H "X-Scope-OrgID: 3" -H "If-Match: 1697726795401423" http://localhost:3100/api/overrides
```

### Versioning

To handle concurrent read and write operations, the backend stores the overrides with a version.
Whenever the overrides are returned, the response has an Etag header with the current version.

```shell
$ curl -v http://localhost:3100/api/overrides
...
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: application/json
< Etag: 1697726795401423
< Date: Wed, 07 Feb 2024 17:49:04 GMT
< Content-Length: 118
...
```

Requests that modify or delete overrides need to pass the current version using the `If-Match` header:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "If-Match: 1697726795401423" http://localhost:3100/api/overrides --data "..."
```

This example uses overrides in the `overrides.json` file with the location in `pwd`:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "X-Scope-OrgID: 3" -H "If-Match: 1697726795401423" http://localhost:3100/api/overrides --data @overrides.json
```

If the version doesn't match the version in the backend, the request is rejected with HTTP error 412.

### Conflicting runtime overrides check

Overrides set through the user-configurable overrides take priority over runtime overrides.
This can lead to misleading scenarios because a value set in the runtime overrides is not actively being used.

To warn users about preexisting runtime overrides, there is an optional check for conflicting runtime overrides.
If enabled requests are rejected if:

1. There are no user-configurable overrides yet for this tenant.
2. There are runtime overrides set that contain overrides present in the user-configurable overrides.

The check can be enabled in the configuration:

```yaml
overrides:
  user_configurable_overrides:
    api:
      check_for_conflicting_runtime_overrides: true
```

You can bypass this check by setting the query parameter `skip-conflicting-overrides-check=true`:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "If-Match: 1697726795401423" http://localhost:3100/api/overrides?skip-conflicting-overrides-check=true --data "..."
```
