# Deploy Tempo with Tempo Operator

The Tempo Operator allows you to configure, install, upgrade, and operate Grafana Tempo on Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.

Some of the operator features are:

* **Resource Limits** - Specify overall resource requests and limits in the `TempoStack` CR; the operator assigns fractions of it to each component
* **AuthN and AuthZ** - Supports OpenID Control (OIDC) and role-based access control (RBAC)
* **Multitenancy** - Multiple tenants can send traces to the same Tempo cluster
* **mTLS** - Communication between the Tempo components can be secured via mTLS
* **Jaeger UI** - Traces can be visualized in Jaeger UI and exposed via Ingress or OpenShift Route
* **Observability** - The operator and `TempoStack` operands expose telemetry (metrics, traces) and integrate with Prometheus `ServiceMonitors`

The source of the Tempo Operator can be found at [grafana/tempo-operator](https://github.com/grafana/tempo-operator).

## Installation

The operator can be installed from:
* [Kubernetes manifest](https://github.com/grafana/tempo-operator/releases/latest/download/tempo-operator.yaml) file on a Kubernetes cluster
* [operatorhub.io](https://operatorhub.io/operator/tempo-operator) on a Kubernetes cluster
* OperatorHub on an OpenShift cluster
