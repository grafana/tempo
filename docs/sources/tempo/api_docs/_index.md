# Tempo HTTP API

Tempo exposes an API for pushing and querying traces, and operating the cluster itself.

For the sake of clarity, API endpoints are grouped by service.
These endpoints are exposed both when running Tempo in microservices and monolithic mode:

- **microservices**: each service exposes its own endpoints
- **monolithic**: the Tempo process exposes all API endpoints for the services running internally

For externally support GRPC API [see below](#tempo-grpc-api)

_For more information, please check out the official documentation of [pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/)._

### Ingest

The Tempo distributor uses the OpenTelemetry Collector receivers as a foundation to ingest trace data.
These APIs are meant to be consumed by the corresponding client SDK or pipeline component, such as Grafana
Agent, OpenTelemetry Collector, or Jaeger Agent.

### Query

The following request is used to retrieve a trace from the query frontend service in
a microservices deployment or the Tempo endpoint in a monolithic mode deployment.

```
GET /api/traces/<traceid>?start=<start>&end=<end>
```
Parameters:
- `start = (unix epoch seconds)`
  Optional.  Along with `end` define a time range from which traces should be returned.
- `end = (unix epoch seconds)`
  Optional.  Along with `start` define a time range from which traces should be returned. Providing both `start` and `end` will include traces for the specified time range only. If the parameters are not provided then Tempo will check for the trace across all blocks in backend. If the parameters are provided, it will only check in the blocks within the specified time range, this can result in trace not being found or partial results if it does not fall in the specified time range.

The following query API is also provided on the querier service for _debugging_ purposes.

```
GET /querier/api/traces/<traceid>?mode=xxxx&blockStart=0000&blockEnd=FFFF&start=<start>&end=<end>
```
Parameters:
- `mode = (blocks|ingesters|all)`
  Specifies whether the querier should look for the trace in blocks, ingesters or both (all).
  Default = `all`
- `blockStart = (GUID)`
  Specifies the blockID start boundary. If specified, the querier will only search blocks with IDs > blockStart.
  Default = `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
  Example: `blockStart=12345678-0000-0000-1235-000001240000`
- `blockEnd = (GUID)`
  Specifies the blockID finish boundary. If specified, the querier will only search blocks with IDs < blockEnd.
  Default = `FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF`
  Example: `blockStart=FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-456787652341`
- `start = (unix epoch seconds)`
  Optional.  Along with `end` define a time range from which traces should be returned.
- `end = (unix epoch seconds)`
  Optional.  Along with `start` define a time range from which traces should be returned. Providing both `start` and `end` will include blocks for the specified time range only.

This API is not meant to be used directly unless for debugging the sharding functionality of the query
frontend.

Returns:
By default this endpoint returns [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/tree/main/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1) JSON,
but if it can also send OpenTelemetry proto if `Accept: application/protobuf` is passed.

### Search

Tempo's Search API finds traces based on span and process attributes (tags and values). Note that search functionality is **not** available on
[v2 blocks]({{< relref "../configuration/parquet#choose-a-different-block-format" >}}).

When performing a search, Tempo does a massively parallel search over the given time range, and takes the first N results. Even identical searches will differ due to things like machine load and network latency. TraceQL follows the same behavior.

The API is available in the query frontend service in
a microservices deployment, or the Tempo endpoint in a monolithic mode deployment.

The following request is used to find traces containing spans from service `myservice` and the url contains `api/myapi`.

```
GET /api/search?tags=service.name%3Dmyservice%20http.url%3Dapi%2Fmyapi
```

The URL query parameters support the following values:

**Parameters for TraceQL Search**
- `q = (TraceQL query)`: Url encoded [TraceQL query]({{< relref "../traceql" >}}).

**Parameters for Tag Based Search**
- `tags = (logfmt)`: logfmt encoding of any span-level or process-level attributes to filter on. The value is matched as a case-insensitive substring. Key-value pairs are separated by spaces. If a value contains a space, it should be enclosed within double quotes.
- `minDuration = (go duration value)`
  Optional.  Find traces with at least this duration.  Duration values are of the form `10s` for 10 seconds, `100ms`, `30m`, etc.
- `maxDuration = (go duration value)`
  Optional.  Find traces with no greater than this duration.  Uses the same form as `minDuration`.

**Parameters supported for all searches**
- `limit = (integer)`
  Optional.  Limit the number of search results. Default is 20, but this is configurable in the querier. Refer to [Configuration]({{< relref "../configuration#querier" >}}).
- `start = (unix epoch seconds)`
  Optional.  Along with `end` define a time range from which traces should be returned.
- `end = (unix epoch seconds)`
 Optional.  Along with `start`, define a time range from which traces should be returned. Providing both `start` and `end` will change the way that Tempo searches.
 If the parameters are not provided, then Tempo will search the recent trace data stored in the ingesters. If the parameters are provided, it will search the backend as well.
 - `spss = (integer)`
  Optional. Limit the number of spans per span-set. Default value is 3.

#### Example of TraceQL search

Example of how to query Tempo using curl.
This query will return all traces that have their status set to error.

```bash
$ curl -G -s http://localhost:3200/api/search --data-urlencode 'q={ status=error }' | jq
{
  "traces": [
    {
      "traceID": "2f3e0cee77ae5dc9c17ade3689eb2e54",

    }
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "inspectedTraces": 3100,
    "inspectedBytes": "3811736",
    "totalBlocks": 3
  }
}
```

### Search tags

Ingester configuration `complete_block_timeout` affects how long tags are available for search.

This endpoint retrieves all discovered tag names that can be used in search.  The endpoint is available in the query frontend service in
a microservices deployment, or the Tempo endpoint in a monolithic mode deployment. The tags endpoint takes a scope that controls the kinds 
of tags or attributes returned. If nothing is provided, the endpoint will return all resource and span tags.

```
GET /api/search/tags?scope=<resource|span|intrinsic>
```

#### Example

Example of how to query Tempo using curl.
This query will return all discovered tag names.

```bash
$ curl -G -s http://localhost:3200/api/search/tags?scope=span  | jq
{
  "tagNames": [
    "host.name",
    "http.method",
    "http.status_code",
    "http.url",
    "ip",
    "load_generator.seq_num",
    "name",
    "region",
    "root_cause_error",
    "sampler.param",
    "sampler.type",
    "service.name",
    "starter",
    "version"
  ]
}
```

### Search tags V2

Ingester configuration `complete_block_timeout` affects how long tags are available for search.

This endpoint retrieves all discovered tag names that can be used in search.  The endpoint is available in the query frontend service in
a microservices deployment, or the Tempo endpoint in a monolithic mode deployment. The tags endpoint takes a scope that controls the kinds 
of tags or attributes returned. If nothing is provided, the endpoint will return all resource and span tags.

```
GET /api/v2/search/tags?scope=<resource|span|intrinsic>
```

#### Example

Example of how to query Tempo using curl.
This query will return all discovered tag names.

```bash
$ curl -G -s http://localhost:3200/api/v2/search/tags  | jq
{
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "span",
      "tags": [
        "article.count",
        "http.flavor",
        "http.method",
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "resource",
      "tags": [
        "k6",
        "service.name"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "intrinsic",
      "tags": [
        "duration",
        "kind",
        "name",
        "status"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Search tag values

Ingester configuration `complete_block_timeout` affects how long tags are available for search.

This endpoint retrieves all discovered values for the given tag, which can be used in search.  The endpoint is available in the query frontend service in
a microservices deployment, or the Tempo endpoint in a monolithic mode deployment.  The following request will return all discovered service names.

```
GET /api/search/tag/service.name/values
```

#### Example

Example of how to query Tempo using curl.
This query will return all discovered values for the tag `service.name`.

```bash
$ curl -G -s http://localhost:3200/api/search/tag/service.name/values  | jq
{
  "tagValues": [
    "adservice",
    "cartservice",
    "checkoutservice",
    "frontend",
    "productcatalogservice",
    "recommendationservice"
  ]
}
```

### Search tag values V2

This endpoint retrieves all discovered values and their data types for the given TraceQL identifier.
The endpoint is available in the query frontend service in a microservices deployment, or the Tempo endpoint in a monolithic mode deployment. This endpoint is similar to `/api/search/tag/<tag>/values` but operates on TraceQL identifiers and types. 
See [TraceQL]({{< relref "../traceql" >}}) documentation for more information.

#### Example

This example queries Tempo using curl and returns all discovered values for the tag `service.name`.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:3200/api/v2/search/tag/.service.name/values | jq .
{
  "tagValues": [
    {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "customer"
    },
    {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "mysql"
    },
    {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "driver"
    },
    {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "frontend"
    },
    {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "redis"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Filtered tag values
If you set Tempo's `autocomplete_filtering_enabled` configuration parameter to `true` (default value is `false`), you can provide an optional URL query parameter, `q` to your request.
The `q` parameter is a URL-encoded [TraceQL query]({{< relref "../traceql" >}}).
If provided, the tag values returned by the API are filtered to only return values seen on spans matching your filter parameters. 

Queries can be incomplete: for example, `{ .cluster = }`. Tempo extracts only the valid matchers and build a valid query. 

Only queries with a single selector `{}` and AND `&&` operators are supported.
  - Example supported: `{ .cluster = "us-east-1" && .service = "frontend" }`
  - Example unsupported: `{ .cluster = "us-east-1" || .service = "frontend" } && { .cluster = "us-east-2" }`

The following request returns all discovered service names on spans with `span.http.method=GET`:

```
GET /api/v2/search/tag/.service.name/values?q="{span.http.method='GET'}"
```

If a particular service name (for example, `shopping-cart`) is only present on spans with `span.http.method=POST`, it would not be included in the list of values returned. 

### Query Echo Endpoint

```
GET /api/echo
```

Returns status code 200 and body `echo` when the query frontend is up and ready to receive requests.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Meant to be used in a Query Visualization UI like Grafana to test that the Tempo data source is working.
{{% /admonition %}}


### Flush

```
GET,POST /flush
```

Triggers a flush of all in-memory traces to the WAL. Useful at the time of rollout restarts and unexpected crashes.

Specify the `tenant` parameter to flush data of a single tenant only.

```
GET,POST /flush?tenant=dev
```

### Shutdown

```
GET,POST /shutdown
```

Flushes all in-memory traces and the WAL to the long term backend. Gracefully exits from the ring. Shuts down the
ingester service.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
This is usually used at the time of scaling down a cluster.
{{% /admonition %}}

## Tempo GRPC API

Tempo uses GRPC to internally communicate with itself, but only has one externally supported client. The query-frontend component implements
the streaming querier interface defined below. [See here](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/pkg/tempopb/) for the complete proto definition and generated code.

By default this service is only offered over the GRPC port. However, one can offer this streaming service over the HTTP port as well (which Grafana expects).
To enable the streaming service over the http port for use with Grafana set the following. 
> **Note**: Enabling this setting is incompatible with TLS.
```
stream_over_http_enabled: true
```
The below `rpc` call returns only traces that are new or have updated each time `SearchResponse` is returned except for the last response. The
final response sent is guaranteed to have the entire resultset.

  rpc Search(SearchRequest) returns (stream SearchResponse);
