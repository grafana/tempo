# Query Tempo with Grafana


Grafana can query Tempo directly. This feature has been enabled since Grafana 7.5.x.

Grafana Cloud comes pre-configured with a Tempo data source.

If you are using Grafana on-prem, you need to [set up the Tempo data source](/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/tempo).

## Configure the data source

To query Tempo with Grafana:

1. Point the Grafana data source at your Tempo query frontend (or monolithic mode Tempo).
1. Enter the URL: `http://<tempo hostname>:<http port number>`. For most of [our examples](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/tree/main/example/docker-compose) the following works.

The port of 3200 is a common port used in our examples. Tempo default HTTP port is 80.

Prior to Grafana 7.5.x, Grafana was not able to query Tempo directly and required an intermediary, Tempoo-Query.
This [the Grafana 7.4.x example](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/tree/main/example/docker-compose/grafana7.4) to explains  configuration. The url entered will be `http://<tempo-query hostname>:16686/`.
