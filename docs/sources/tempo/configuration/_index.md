# Configure Tempo

This document explains the configuration options for Tempo as well as the details of what they impact.

{{% admonition type="tip" %}}
Instructions for configuring Tempo data sources are available in the [Grafana Cloud](/docs/grafana-cloud/send-data/traces/) and [Grafana](/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/tempo/) documentation.
{{% /admonition %}}

The Tempo configuration options include:

- [Configure Tempo](#configure-tempo)
  - [Use environment variables in the configuration](#use-environment-variables-in-the-configuration)
  - [Server](#server)
  - [Distributor](#distributor)
  - [Ingester](#ingester)

  - [Query-frontend](#query-frontend)
  - [Querier](#querier)
  - [Compactor](#compactor)
  - [Storage](#storage)
    - [Local storage recommendations](#local-storage-recommendations)
    - [Storage block configuration example](#storage-block-configuration-example)
  - [Memberlist](#memberlist)
  - [Overrides](#overrides)
    - [Ingestion limits](#ingestion-limits)

  - [Cache](#cache)

Additionally, you can review [TLS]({{< relref "./network/tls" >}}) to configure the cluster components to communicate over TLS, or receive traces over TLS.

## Use environment variables in the configuration

You can use environment variable references in the configuration file to set values that need to be configurable during deployment. To do this, pass `-config.expand-env=true` and use:

```
${VAR}
```

Where `VAR` is the name of the environment variable.

Each variable reference is replaced at startup by the value of the environment variable.
The replacement is case-sensitive and occurs before the YAML file is parsed.
References to undefined variables are replaced by empty strings unless you specify a default value or custom error text.

To specify a default value, use:

```
${VAR:-default_value}
```

where `default_value` is the value to use if the environment variable is undefined.

You can find more about other supported syntax [here](https://github.com/drone/envsubst/blob/master/readme.md).

## Server

Tempo uses the server from `dskit/server`. For more information on configuration options, see [here](https://github.com/grafana/dskit/blob/main/server/server.go#L66).

```yaml
# Optional. Setting to true enables multitenancy and requires X-Scope-OrgID header on all requests.
[multitenancy_enabled: <bool> | default = false]

# Optional. Setting to true enables query filtering in tag value search API `/api/v2/search/<tag>/values`.
# If filtering is enabled, the API accepts a query parameter `q` containing a TraceQL query,
# and returns only tag values that match the query.
[autocomplete_filtering_enabled: <bool> | default = true]

# Optional. String prefix for all http api endpoints. Must include beginning slash.
[http_api_prefix: <string>]

server:
    # HTTP server listen host
    [http_listen_address: <string>]

    # HTTP server listen port
    [http_listen_port: <int> | default = 80]

    # gRPC server listen host
    [grpc_listen_address: <string>]

    # gRPC server listen port
    [grpc_listen_port: <int> | default = 9095]

    # Register instrumentation handlers (/metrics, etc.)
    [register_instrumentation: <boolean> | default = true]

    # Timeout for graceful shutdowns
    [graceful_shutdown_timeout: <duration> | default = 30s]

    # Read timeout for HTTP server
    [http_server_read_timeout: <duration> | default = 30s]

    # Write timeout for HTTP server
    [http_server_write_timeout: <duration> | default = 30s]

    # Idle timeout for HTTP server
    [http_server_idle_timeout: <duration> | default = 120s]

    # Max gRPC message size that can be received
    # This value may need to be increased if you have large traces
    [grpc_server_max_recv_msg_size: <int> | default = 4194304]

    # Max gRPC message size that can be sent
    # This value may need to be increased if you have large traces
    [grpc_server_max_send_msg_size: <int> | default = 4194304]
```

## Distributor

For more information on configuration options, see [here](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/modules/distributor/config.go).

Distributors receive spans and forward them to the appropriate ingesters.

The following configuration enables all available receivers with their default configuration. For a production deployment, enable only the receivers you need.
Additional documentation and more advanced configuration options are available in [the receiver README](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/README.md).

```yaml
# Distributor config block
distributor:

    # receiver configuration for different protocols
    # config is passed down to opentelemetry receivers
    # for a production deployment you should only enable the receivers you need!
    receivers:
        otlp:
            protocols:
                grpc:

            protocols:
                thrift_http:
                grpc:
                thrift_binary:
                thrift_compact:
        zipkin:
        opencensus:
        kafka:

    # Optional.
    # Configures forwarders that asynchronously replicate ingested traces
    # to specified endpoints. Forwarders work on per-tenant basis, so to
    # fully enable this feature, overrides configuration must also be updated.
    #
    # Note: Forwarders work asynchronously and can fail or decide not to forward
    # some traces. This feature works in a "best-effort" manner.
    forwarders:

        # Forwarder name. Must be unique within the list of forwarders.
        # This name can be referenced in the overrides configuration to
        # enable forwarder for a tenant.
      - name: <string>

        # The forwarder backend to use
        # Should be "otlpgrpc".
        backend: <string>

        # otlpgrpc configuration. Will be used only if value of backend is "otlpgrpc".
        otlpgrpc:

          # List of otlpgrpc compatible endpoints.
          endpoints: <list of string>
          tls:

            # Optional.
            # Disables TSL if set to true.
            [insecure: <boolean> | default = false]

            # Optional.
            # Path to the TLS certificate. This field must be set if insecure = false.
            [cert_file: <string | default = "">]

        # Optional.
        # Configures filtering in forwarder that lets you drop spans and span events using
        # the OpenTelemetry Transformation Language (OTTL) syntax. For detailed overview of
        # the OTTL syntax, please refer to the official Open Telemetry documentation.
        filter:
            traces:
                span: <list of string>
                spanevent: <list of string>
      - (repetition of above...)


    # Optional.
    # Enable to log every received span to help debug ingestion or calculate span error distributions using the logs
    # This is not recommended for production environments
    log_received_spans:
        [enabled: <boolean> | default = false]
        [include_all_attributes: <boolean> | default = false]
        [filter_by_status_error: <boolean> | default = false]

    # Optional.

    metric_received_spans:
        [enabled: <boolean> | default = false]
        [root_only: <boolean> | default = false]

    # Optional.
    # Disables write extension with inactive ingesters. Use this along with ingester.lifecycler.unregister_on_shutdown = true
    #  note that setting these two config values reduces tolerance to failures on rollout b/c there is always one guaranteed to be failing replica
    [extend_writes: <bool>]

    # Optional.
    # Configures the time to retry after returned to the client when Tempo returns a GRPC ResourceExhausted. This parameter
    # defaults to 0 which means that by default ResourceExhausted is not retried. Set this to a duration such as `1s` to
    # instruct the client how to retry.
    [retry_after_on_resource_exhausted: <duration> | default = '0' ]
```

## Ingester

For more information on configuration options, see [here](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/modules/ingester/config.go).

The ingester is responsible for batching up traces and pushing them to [TempoDB](#storage).

A live, or active, trace is a trace that has received a new batch of spans in more than a configured amount of time (default 10 seconds, set by `ingester.trace_idle_period`).
After 10 seconds (or the configured amount of time), the trace is flushed to disk and appended to the WAL.
When Tempo receives a new batch, a new live trace is created in memory.

```yaml
# Ingester configuration block
ingester:

    # Lifecycler is responsible for managing the lifecycle of entries in the ring.
    # For a complete list of config options check the lifecycler section under the ingester config at the following link -
    # https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#ingester_config
    lifecycler:
        ring:
            # number of replicas of each span to make while pushing to the backend
            replication_factor: 3
            # set sidecar proxy port
            [port: <int>]

    # amount of time a trace must be idle before flushing it to the wal.
    # (default: 10s)
    [trace_idle_period: <duration>]

    # how often to sweep all tenants and move traces from live -> wal -> completed blocks.
    # (default: 10s)
    [flush_check_period: <duration>]

    # maximum size of a block before cutting it
    # (default: 524288000 = 500MB)
    [max_block_bytes: <int>]

    # maximum length of time before cutting a block
    # (default: 30m)
    [max_block_duration: <duration>]

    # duration to keep blocks in the ingester after they have been flushed
    # (default: 15m)
    [ complete_block_timeout: <duration>]

    # Flush all traces to backend when ingester is stopped
    [flush_all_on_shutdown: <bool> | default = false]
```

## Metrics-generator

For more information on configuration options, see [here](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/modules/generator/config.go).

The metrics-generator processes spans and write metrics using the Prometheus remote write protocol.
For more information on the metrics-generator, refer to the [Metrics-generator documentation]({{< relref "../metrics-generator" >}}).

Metrics-generator processors are disabled by default. To enable it for a specific tenant, set `metrics_generator.processors` in the [overrides](#overrides) section.

You can limit spans with end times that occur within a configured duration to be considered in metrics generation using `metrics_ingestion_time_range_slack`.
In Grafana Cloud, this value defaults to 30 seconds so all spans sent to the metrics-generation more than 30 seconds in the past are discarded or rejected.



```yaml
# Metrics-generator configuration block
metrics_generator:

    # Ring configuration
    ring:

      kvstore:

        # The metrics-generator uses the ring to balance work across instances. The ring is stored
        # in a key-vault store.

    # Processor-specific configuration
    processor:

        service_graphs:

            [wait: <duration> | default = 10s]

            # MaxItems is the amount of edges that will be stored in the store.
            [max_items: <int> | default = 10000]

            # Workers is the amount of workers that will be used to process the edges
            [workers: <int> | default = 10]

            # resource and span attributes and are added to the metrics if present.
            [dimensions: <list of string>]

            # Prefix additional dimensions with "client_" and "_server". Adds two labels
            # per additional dimension instead of one.

            # Custom labeling of dimensions is possible via a list of maps consisting of
            # "name" <string>, "source_labels" <list of string>, "join" <string>
            # "name" appears in the metrics, "source_labels" are the actual
            # attributes that will make up the value of the label and "join" is the
            # separator if multiple source_labels are provided

```

## Query-frontend

For more information on configuration options, see [here](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/modules/frontend/config.go).

The Query Frontend is responsible for sharding incoming requests for faster processing in parallel (by the queriers).

```yaml
# Query Frontend configuration block
query_frontend:

    # number of times to retry a request sent to a querier
    # (default: 2)
    [max_retries: <int>]

    # Maximum number of outstanding requests per tenant per frontend; requests beyond this error with HTTP 429.
    # (default: 2000)
    [max_outstanding_per_tenant: <int>]

    # The number of jobs to batch together in one http request to the querier. Set to 1 to
    # disable.
    # (default: 5)
    [max_batch_size: <int>]

    # Enable multi-tenant queries.
    # If enabled, queries can be federated across multiple tenants.
    # The tenant IDs involved need to be specified separated by a '|'
    # character in the 'X-Scope-OrgID' header.
    # note: this is no-op if cluster doesn't have `multitenancy_enabled: true`
    # (default: true)
    [multi_tenant_queries_enabled: <bool>]

    # Comma-separated list of request header names to include in query logs. Applies
    # to both query stats and slow queries logs.
    [log_query_request_headers: <string> | default = ""]

    # Set a maximum timeout for all api queries at which point the frontend will cancel queued jobs
    # and return cleanly. HTTP will return a 503 and GRPC will return a context canceled error.
    # This timeout impacts all http and grpc streaming queries as part of the Tempo api surface such as
    # search, metrics summary, tags and tag values lookups, etc.
    # Generally it is preferred to let the client cancel context. This is a failsafe to prevent a client
    # from imposing more work on Tempo than desired.
    # (default: 0)
    [api_timeout: <duration>]

    search:

        # The number of concurrent jobs to execute when searching the backend.
        # (default: 1000)

        # (default: 20)
        [default_result_limit: <int>]

        # The maximum allowed value of the limit parameter on search requests. If the search request limit parameter
        # exceeds the value configured here the frontend will return a 400.
        # The default value of 0 disables this limit.
        # (default: 0)
        [max_result_limit: <int>]

        # The maximum allowed time range for a search.
        # 0 disables this limit.
        # (default: 168h)

        # query_backend_after and query_ingesters_until together control where the query-frontend searches for traces.
        # Time ranges before query_ingesters_until will be searched in the ingesters only.
        # Time ranges after query_backend_after will be searched in the backend/object storage only.
        # Time ranges from query_backend_after through query_ingesters_until will be queried from both locations.
        # query_backend_after must be less than or equal to query_ingesters_until.

        [query_backend_after: <duration>]

        # (default: 30m)
        [query_ingesters_until: <duration>]

        # If set to a non-zero value, it's value will be used to decide if query is within SLO or not.
        # Query is within SLO if it returned 200 within duration_slo seconds OR processed throughput_slo bytes/s data.
        # NOTE: `duration_slo` and `throughput_bytes_slo` both must be configured for it to work
        [duration_slo: <duration> | default = 0s ]

        # If set to a non-zero value, it's value will be used to decide if query is within SLO or not.
        # Query is within SLO if it returned 200 within duration_slo seconds OR processed throughput_slo bytes/s data.
        [throughput_bytes_slo: <float> | default = 0 ]


    # Trace by ID lookup configuration
    trace_by_id:
        # The number of shards to split a trace by id query into.
        # (default: 50)
        [query_shards: <int>]

        # The maximum number of shards to execute at once. If set to 0 query_shards is used.
        # (default: 0)
        [concurrent_shards: <int>]

        # If set to a non-zero value, a second request will be issued at the provided duration.

        [query_backend_after: <duration> | default = 30m ]

        # The target length of time for each job to handle when querying the backend. 
        [interval: <duration> | default = 5m ]
```

## Querier

For more information on configuration options, see [here](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/modules/querier/config.go).

The Querier is responsible for querying the backends/cache for the traceID.

```yaml
# querier config block
querier:

    # The query frontend turns both trace by id (/api/traces/<id>) and search (/api/search?<params>) requests
    # into subqueries that are then pulled and serviced by the queriers.
    # This value controls the overall number of simultaneous subqueries that the querier will service at once. It does
    # not distinguish between the types of queries.

## Compactor

For more information on configuration options, see [here](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/modules/compactor/config.go).

Compactors stream blocks from the storage backend, combine them and write them back.  Values shown below are the defaults.

```yaml
compactor:

    # Optional. Disables backend compaction.  Default is false.
    # Note: This should only be used in a non-production context for debugging purposes.  This will allow blocks to say in the backend for further investigation if desired.
    [disabled: <bool>]

    ring:

        kvstore:

            # in a high volume environment multiple compactors need to work together to keep up with incoming blocks.
            # this tells the compactors to use a ring stored in memberlist to coordinate.
            # Example: "store: memberlist"
            [store: <string>]

    compaction:

        # Optional. Duration to keep blocks.  Default is 14 days (336h).
        [block_retention: <duration>]

        # Optional. Duration to keep blocks that have been compacted elsewhere. Default is 1h.
        [compacted_block_retention: <duration>]

        # Optional. Blocks in this time window will be compacted together. Default is 1h.
        [compaction_window: <duration>]

        # Optional. Maximum number of traces in a compacted block. Default is 6 million.
        # WARNING: Deprecated. Use max_block_bytes instead.
        [max_compaction_objects: <int>]

        # Optional. Maximum size of a compacted block in bytes.  Default is 100 GB.
        [max_block_bytes: <int>]

        # Optional. Number of tenants to process in parallel during retention. Default is 10.
        [retention_concurrency: <int>]

        # Optional. The maximum amount of time to spend compacting a single tenant before moving to the next. Default is 5m.
        [max_time_per_tenant: <duration>]

        # Optional. The time between compaction cycles. Default is 30s.
        # Note: The default will be used if the value is set to 0.
        [compaction_cycle: <duration>]

        # Optional. Amount of data to buffer from input blocks. Default is 5 MiB.
        [v2_in_buffer_bytes: <int>]

        # Optional. Flush data to backend when buffer is this large. Default is 20 MB.
        [v2_out_buffer_bytes: <int>]

        # Optional. Number of traces to buffer in memory during compaction. Increasing may improve performance but will also increase memory usage. Default is 1000.
        [v2_prefetch_traces_count: <int>]
```

## Storage

Tempo supports Amazon S3, GCS, Azure, and local file system for storage. In addition, you can use Memcached or Redis for increased query performance.

For more information on configuration options, see [here](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/tempodb/config.go).

### Local storage recommendations

While you can use local storage, object storage is recommended for production workloads.
A local backend will not correctly retrieve traces with a distributed deployment unless all components have access to the same disk.
Tempo is designed for object storage more than local storage.

At Grafana Labs, we have run Tempo with SSDs when using local storage. Hard drives have not been tested.

How much storage space you need can be estimated by considering the ingested bytes and retention. For example, ingested bytes per day *times* retention days = stored bytes.

You can not use both local and object storage in the same Tempo deployment.

### Storage block configuration example

The storage block is used to configure TempoDB.
The following example shows common options. For further platform-specific information, refer to the following:

* [GCS]({{< relref "./hosted-storage/gcs" >}})
* [S3]({{< relref "./hosted-storage/s3" >}})
* [Azure]({{< relref "./hosted-storage/azure" >}})
* [Parquet]({{< relref "./parquet" >}})

## Memberlist

[Memberlist](https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist) is the default mechanism for all of the Tempo pieces to coordinate with each other.

```yaml
memberlist:
    # Name of the node in memberlist cluster. Defaults to hostname.
    [node_name: <string> | default = ""]

    # Add random suffix to the node name.

    # How many nodes to gossip to.
    [gossip_nodes: <int> | default = 2]

    # How long to keep gossiping to dead nodes, to give them chance to refute their

    # only few components as a seed nodes (via -memberlist.join), then it's
    # recommended to use rejoin. If -memberlist.join points to dynamic service that
    # resolves to all gossiping nodes (eg. Kubernetes headless service), then rejoin
    # is not needed.
    [rejoin_interval: <duration> | default = 0s]

    # How long to keep LEFT ingesters in the ring.
    [left_ingesters_timeout: <duration> | default = 5m]

    # Timeout for leaving memberlist cluster.
    [leave_timeout: <duration> | default = 5s]

## Overrides

Tempo provides an overrides module for users to set global or per-tenant override settings.

### Ingestion limits

The default limits in Tempo may not be sufficient in high-volume tracing environments.
Errors including `RATE_LIMITED`/`TRACE_TOO_LARGE`/`LIVE_TRACES_EXCEEDED` occur when these limits are exceeded.
See below for how to override these limits globally or per tenant.

#### Standard overrides

You can create an `overrides` section to configure new ingestion limits that applies to all tenants of the cluster.
A snippet of a `config.yaml` file showing how the overrides section is [here](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/a000a0d461221f439f585e7ed55575e7f51a0acd/integration/bench/config.yaml#L39-L40).

#### Tenant-specific overrides

There are two types of tenant-specific overrides:
- runtime overrides
- user-configurable overrides

##### Runtime overrides

You can set tenant-specific overrides settings in a separate file and point `per_tenant_override_config` to it.
This overrides file is dynamically loaded.
It can be changed at runtime and reloaded by Tempo without restarting the application.
These override settings can be set per tenant.

```yaml
# /conf/tempo.yaml
# Overrides configuration block
overrides:
   per_tenant_override_config: /conf/overrides.yaml

---
# /conf/overrides.yaml
# Tenant-specific overrides configuration
overrides:

  "<tenant-id>":
      ingestion:
        [burst_size_bytes: <int>]
        [rate_limit_bytes: <int>]
        [max_traces_per_user: <int>]
      global:
        [max_bytes_per_trace: <int>]

  # A "wildcard" override can be used that will apply to all tenants if a match is not found otherwise.
  "*":
    ingestion:
      [burst_size_bytes: <int>]
      [rate_limit_bytes: <int>]
      [max_traces_per_user: <int>]
    global:
      [max_bytes_per_trace: <int>]
```

##### User-configurable overrides

These tenant-specific overrides are stored in an object store and can be modified using API requests.
User-configurable overrides have priority over runtime overrides.
See [user-configurable overrides]{{< relref "../operations/user-configurable-overrides" >}} for more details.

#### Override strategies

The trace limits specified by the various parameters are, by default, applied as per-distributor limits.
For example, a `max_traces_per_user` setting of 10000 means that each distributor within the cluster has a limit of 10000 traces per user.
This is known as a `local` strategy in that the specified trace limits are local to each distributor.

A setting that applies at a local level is quite helpful in ensuring that each distributor independently can process traces up to the limit without affecting the tracing limits on other distributors.

However, as a cluster grows quite large, this can lead to quite a large quantity of traces.
An alternative strategy may be to set a `global` trace limit that establishes a total budget of all traces across all distributors in the cluster.
The global limit is averaged across all distributors by using the distributor ring.

```yaml
# /conf/tempo.yaml
overrides:
  defaults:
    ingestion:
      [rate_strategy: <global|local> | default = local]
```

For example, this configuration specifies that each instance of the distributor will apply a limit of `15MB/s`.

```yaml
overrides:
  defaults:
    ingestion:
      strategy: local
      limit_bytes: 15000000
```

This configuration specifies that together, all distributor instances will apply a limit of `15MB/s`.
So if there are 5 instances, each instance will apply a local limit of `(15MB/s / 5) = 3MB/s`.

```yaml
overrides:
  defaults:
    ingestion:
      strategy: global
      limit_bytes: 15000000
```

## Usage-report

By default, Tempo will report anonymous usage data about the shape of a deployment to Grafana Labs.
This data is used to determine how common the deployment of certain features are, if a feature flag has been enabled,
and which replication factor or compression levels are used.

By providing information on how people use Tempo, usage reporting helps the Tempo team decide where to focus their development and documentation efforts. No private information is collected, and all reports are completely anonymous.

Reporting is controlled by a configuration option.

The following configuration values are used:

- Receivers enabled
- Frontend concurrency and version
- Storage cache, backend, wal and block encodings
- Ring replication factor, and `kvstore`
- Features toggles enabled

No performance data is collected.

You can disable the automatic reporting of this generic information using the following
configuration:

```yaml
usage_report:
  reporting_enabled: false
```

If you are using a Helm chart, you can enable or disable usage reporting by changing the `reportingEnabled` value.
This value is available in the the [tempo-distributed](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/tempo-distributed) and the [tempo](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/tempo) Helm charts.

```yaml
# -- If true, Tempo will report anonymous usage data about the shape of a deployment to Grafana Labs
reportingEnabled: true
```

## Cache

Use this block to configure caches available throughout the application. Multiple caches can be created and assigned roles
which determine how they are used by Tempo.

```yaml
cache:
    # Background cache configuration. Requires having a cache configured. These settings apply
    # to all configured caches.
    background:

        # At what concurrency to write back to cache. Default is 10.
        [writeback_goroutines: <int>]

        # How many key batches to buffer for background write-back. Default is 10000.
        [writeback_buffer: <int>]

    caches:

        # Roles determine how this cache is used in Tempo. Roles must be unique across all caches and
        # every cache must have at least one role.
        # Allowed values:
        #   bloom              - Bloom filters for trace id lookup.
        #   parquet-footer     - Parquet footer values. Useful for search and trace by id lookup.
        #   parquet-page       - Parquet "pages". WARNING: This will attempt to cache most reads from parquet and, as a result, is very high volume.
        #   frontend-search    - Frontend search job results.

    -   roles:
        - <role1>
        - <role2>

        # Memcached caching configuration block
        memcached:

            # Hostname for memcached service to use. If empty and if addresses is unset, no memcached will be used.
