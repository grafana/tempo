# S3 Configuration
S3 backend is configured in the storage block.  Tempo requires a dedicated bucket since it maintains a top-level object structure and does not support a custom prefix to nest within a shared bucket.

```
storage:
    trace:
        backend: s3                                         # store traces in s3
        s3:
            bucket: tempo                                   # store traces in this bucket
            endpoint: s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com  # api endpoint
            access_key: ...                                 # optional. access key when using static credentials. 
            secret_key: ...                                 # optional. secret key when using static credentials.
            insecure: false                                 # optional. enable if endpoint is http
```

## Permissions
The following authentication methods are supported:
- AWS environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- Static access key and secret credentials specified in `access_key` and `secret_key`
- MinIO environment variables MINIO_ACCESS_KEY and MINIO_SECRET_KEY
- AWS shared credentials [configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/create-shared-credentials-file.html)
- MinIO client credentials [configuration file](https://github.com/minio/mc/blob/master/docs/minio-client-configuration-files.md)
- AWS IAM ([IRSA via WebIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html), 
- AWS [EC2 instance role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html))

The following IAM policy shows minimal permissions required by Tempo, where the bucket has already been created.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "TempoPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucketname>/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucketname>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Lifecycle Policy
