# Quick start for Tempo

The Tempo repository provides [multiple examples](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/tree/main/example/docker-compose) to help you quickly get started using Tempo and tracing data.

Every example has a `docker-compose.yaml` manifest that includes all of the options needed to explore trace data in Grafana, including resource configuration and trace data generation. The Tempo examples running with docker-compose all include a version of Tempo and a storage backend like S3 and GCS.

This quick start guide uses the `local` example. Any data is stored locally in the `tempo-data` folder. To learn more, read the [local storage example REAMDE](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/example/docker-compose/local).


## Before you begin

To follow this guide, you need:

- Git, Docker, and docker-compose plugin


## Steps

1. Clone the Tempo repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/grafana/tempo.git
   ```

1. Go into the examples directory:
   ```
   cd tempo/example/docker-compose/local
   ```

1. Start the services that are defined in the docker-compose file:
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

1. Verify that the services are running using `docker compose ps`. You should see something like:
   ```
   docker compose ps
   NAME                 COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
   local-grafana-1      "/run.sh"                grafana             running             0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
   local-k6-tracing-1   "/k6-tracing run /ex…"   k6-tracing          running
   local-prometheus-1   "/bin/prometheus --c…"   prometheus          running             0.0.0.0:9090->9090/tcp
   local-tempo-1        "/tempo -config.file…"   tempo               running             0.0.0.0:3200->3200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:4317-4318->4317-4318/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9411->9411/tcp, 0.0.0.0:14268->14268/tcp
   ```

1. As part of the docker compose manifest, Grafana is now reachable on port 3000. Open a browser to localhost:3000 and sign in to Grafana.

1. Once logged in, navigate to the **Explore** page, select the **Tempo** data source and select the **Search** tab. Select **Run query** to list the recent traces stored in Tempo. Select one to view the trace diagram:

1. Alter the Tempo configuration to point to the instance of Prometheus running in docker compose. To do so, edit the configuration at `/etc/tempo/config.yaml` and change the `storage` block under the `metrics_generator` section so that the remote write url is `http://localhost:9090`. The configuration section should look like this:
   ```
    storage:
        path: /tmp/tempo/generator/wal
        remote_write:
           - url: http://localhost:9090/api/v1/write
           send_exemplars: true

   ```
   Save the file and exit the editor.

1. Finally, restart the Tempo service by running:

    ```
   sudo systemctl restart tempo
   ```

1. A couple of minutes after Tempo has successfully restarted, select the **Service graph** tab for the Tempo data source in the **Explore** page. Select **Run query** to view a service graph, generated by Tempo’s metrics-generator.

1.  To stop the service:
   ```
   docker-compose down -v
   ```
