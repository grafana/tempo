# Getting started with Tempo

Getting started with Tempo is easy.

- For an application already instrumented for tracing, [this guide]({{< relref "quickstart-tempo.md" >}}) can help quickly set it up with Tempo.
- If you're looking for a demo application to play around with Tempo, check the [examples with demo app]({{< relref "example-demo-app.md" >}}) topic.

> **Note:** The Grafana Cloud Agent is already set up to use Tempo. Refer to the [configuration](https://github.com/grafana/agent/blob/master/docs/configuration-reference.md#tempo_config) and [example](https://github.com/grafana/agent/blob/master/example/docker-compose/agent/config/agent.yaml) for details.
