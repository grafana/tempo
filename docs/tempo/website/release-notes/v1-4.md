# Version 1.4 release notes

The Tempo team is excited to announce the release of Tempo 1.4.

## Features and enhancements

- **Server side metrics** As the headline feature for Tempo 1.4, [Server-side metrics](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/server_side_metrics/)
  generate metrics from your traces, for advanced insight into your application's performance over time.

- **Start and end time** `start` and `end` parameters were added to the `/api/traces/{traceID}`
  endpoint. This allows more efficient searches by only querying a subset of blocks
  on the backend. [PR 1388](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1388)

- **Protect instances from very large traces** Additional protection against large
  traces has been added. These features all key off the existing `max_bytes_per_trace`
  configuration parameter. [PR 1317](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1317) and [PR 1318](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1318)

- **Hedge everything** Improve backend search throughput Tempo using our favorite solution: hedging.
  ```
  querier:
    search:
      external_hedge_requests_at: 5s
      external_hedge_requests_up_to: 3
  ```

## Upgrade considerations

When upgrading to Tempo v1.4, be aware of these breaking changes:

- [PR 1227](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1227) A new ingestion endpoint was added to the ingesters in Tempo 1.4 to support faster search and proper start/end times on blocks. Please rollout all ingesters before rolling the distributors to prevent downtime. Also, during this period, the ingesters will use considerably more resources and should be scaled up (or incoming traffic should be heavily throttled). Once all distributors and ingesters have rolled performance will return to normal. Internally we have observed ~1.5x CPU load on the ingesters during the rollout.

- [PR 1350](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1350) A few querier options were moved while adding hedging to external endpoints.
  ```yaml
  querier:
  search_query_timeout: 30s
  search_external_endpoints: []
  search_prefer_self: 2
  ```
  was relocated to
  ```yaml
  querier:
  search:
      query_timeout: 30s
      prefer_self: 2
      external_endpoints: []
  ```

- [PR 1297](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1297) Updated the vult to test full backend search and as a result dropped the CLI parameter `tempo-search-retention-duration`.

## Bug fixes

### 1.4.0 bug fixes

- [PR 1390](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1390) In some cases Azure "Blob Not Found" errors were not correctly handled by Tempo. 

- [PR 1314](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1314) Fixes the issues where block start/end times were based on trace ingestion instead of actual trace start/end times.

- [PR 1387](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1387) Prevents a data race / ingester crash during searching by trace id.

- [PR 1372](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1372) Fix spurious "failed to mark block compacted during retention" errors.

- [PR 1379](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1379) Fix error message "Writer is closed" by resetting compression writer correctly on the error path.
