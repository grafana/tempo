# Version 1.3 release notes

The Tempo team is excited to announce the release of Tempo 1.3.

## Features and enhancements

- **Search** In addition to the existing search of recent traces,
support has been added to search traces in the backend store.
Refer to [Tempo search](../../getting-started/tempo-in-grafana#tempo-search)
for details.

- **Improve ring functionality** The compactor ring automatically forgets about unhealthy ring members.

- **Protect instances from very large traces** The ingester keeps track of
traces that exceed the configured maximum size,
extending protection from very large traces to after the traces are flushed
to disk.

- **Expose additional metrics** These new metrics  are exposed:
    - `tempo_limits_overrides`
    - `tempo_limits_defaults`
    - `tempo_ingester_live_traces`
    - `tempodb_compaction_outstanding_blocks`

- **Azure credentials may be set in the environment** Instead of setting values
in the configuration,
environment variables may specify `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` and `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY`.
