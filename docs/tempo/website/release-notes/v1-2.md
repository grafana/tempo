# Version 1.2 release notes

The Tempo team is excited to announce the release of Tempo 1.2. This release introduces native search.

## Features and enhancements

* **Recent traces search** The headline feature of Tempo 1.2 is the ability to search for data that is still in the ingester component. This experimental feature must be enabled using feature flags in both Grafana and Tempo. Refer to [Tempo search](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/getting-started/tempo-in-grafana/#tempo-search) for details.
* **Scalable single binary deployment mode** The new [scalable single binary](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/operations/deployment/#scalable-single-binary) deployment mode is operationally simpler, although less robust than a fully distributed deployment. We consider it a balanced operational mode that some may find attractive.
* **Massive performance improvements** were achieved by more efficiently batching trace data being ingested. In terms of CPU needed, Tempo v1.2 is twice as efficient as Tempo v1.1. Refer to [PR 1075](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1075) for details.
* **API improvements** Some informational endpoints were consolidated within the [`status` endpoint](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/api_docs/#status). New endpoints were also added.

## Upgrade considerations

There are a few small things to be aware of when upgrading to Tempo 1.2:

* Support for v0 and v1 blocks were dropped as announced when 1.1 was cut. See the [1.1 changelog](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/releases/tag/v1.1.0) for details.
* [Small adjustments](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1007) were made to the Querier API. When rolling a deployment there will be a read outage until all queries and query frontends have rolled to the latest version.
* Various configuration and status endpoints were consolidated under [/status](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/api_docs/#status).
* Two metrics ([`ingester_bytes_metric_total`](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/979), [`cortex_runtime_config_last_reload_successful`](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/945)) and one cli param ([`-storage.trace.blocklist_poll`](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/897)) were renamed for clarity`.
