# This checks merged PRs for labels like "backport release-x.y" 
# and opens a new PR backporting the same commit to the release branch.
# This workflow also runs when the PR is labeled or opened, but will
# will only check a few things and detect that the PR is not yet merged. 
# At this time only squashed PRs are supported since the cherry-pick 
# command does not include "-m <n>" arg required for merge commits.
