- Performance & load testing: powered by Grafana k6
- Synthetic Monitoring: powered by Grafana k6
- Grafana IRM: observability native incident response
- Incident: routine task automation for incidents
- OnCall: flexible on-call management

If a product name starts with "Grafana",
use the full name on first use and short name after, for example:

- Grafana Alloy (full), Alloy (short)
- Grafana Beyla (full), Beyla (short)

Refer to the "OpenTelemetry Collector" as "Collector" after the first use.
Still use "OpenTelemetry Collector" when referring to a distribution,
and for headings and links.

Always use the full name for "Grafana Cloud".

Never use abbreviations for product names unless specifically asked to,
for example:

- use "OpenTelemetry" (correct) and not "OTel" (wrong)
- use "Kubernetes" (correct) and not "K8s" (wrong)

Refer to metrics, logs, traces, and profiles in that order.
If referring to a subset, still use this ordering, for example:

- metrics, logs, and traces (correct)
- traces and profiles (correct), profiles and traces (wrong)
- metrics and logs (correct), logs and metrics (wrong)

You can freely mention open source projects, for example:

- Prometheus
- OpenTelemetry
- Linux
- Docker
- Kubernetes

Only mention other companies or products for integrations or migrations.
Focus on Grafana and not the partner product, for example:

- For an integration with Azure don't document Azure set up
- For a migration from DataDog don't document DataDog set up or usage

## frontmatter

Never remove front matter content at the start of the file.
This includes all content from the start of the file,
inbetween a pair of tripple dashes (---).

Never removed YAML front matter meta data unless specifically asked to.

For example, never remove or delete this or other front matter:

```markdown
---
title: OpenTelemetry
cascade:
  search_section: OpenTelemetry
  search_type: doc
---

# OpenTelemetry

Markdown content...
```

Only edit front matter copy if specifically asked to.
When performing a copy edit task,
ask the user if they'd like you to also edit the front matter copy.
Still never remove front matter meta data properpties.

## Structure

Structure articles into sections with headings.

The frontmatter YAML `title` and the content h1 (#) heading should be the same.
Never remove the content h1 heading, this redundancy is required.

Always include copy after a heading, for example:

```markdown
## Heading

Immediately followed by copy and not another heading.
```

Never nest a heading immediately after another heading, for example:

```markdown
## Heading

## Sub heading
```

Add a blank line after headings, for example:

```markdown
## Heading

Copy after the heading and a blank line.
```

The immediate copy after a heading should introduce and overview what is
covered in the section.

Start articles with an introduction that covers the goal of the article,
example goals:

- Learn concepts
- Set up or install something
- Configure something
- Use a product to solve a business problem
- Troubleshoot a problem
- Integrate with other software or systems
- Migrate from one thing to another
- Refer to APIs or reference documentation

Follow the goal with a list of prerequisites, for example:

```markdown
Before you begin ensure you have the following:

- <Prerequisite 1>
- <Prerequisite 2>
- ...
```

Suggest and link to next steps and related resources at the end of the article,
for example:

- Learn more about A, B, C
- Configure X
- Use X to achieve Y
- Use X to achieve Z
- Project homepage or documentation
- Project repository (for example, GitHub, GitLab)
- Project package (for example, pip or npm)

You don't need to use the "Refer to..." syntax for next steps,
use the list time text for the link text.

## Style

Write simple copy.

Write short sentences and paragraphs.

Use short words whenever possible, for example:

- use "use" and not "utilize"
- use "use" and not "make use of"

Always use contractions over multiple words, for example:

- use "it's" and not "it is"
- use "isn't" and not "is not"
- use "that's" and not "that is"
- use "you're" and not "you are"
- use "Don't" and not "do not"

Don't use filler words or phrases, for example:

- "there is"
- "there are"
- "in order to"
- "it is important to"
- "keep in mind"

In most cases, use verbs and nouns without adverbs or adjectives.
You may use minimal adverbs and adjectives,
when introucing or overviewing a Grafana Labs product.

Don't use figures of speech.

Never use buzzwords, jargon, or cliches.

Never use cultural references or charged language.

## Tense

Write in present simple tense.

Avoid present continous tense.

Only write in future tense to show future actions.

## Voice

Always write in an active voice.

Never write in a passive voice.

## Perspective

Address users as "you".

Don't use first person perspective.

## Wordlist

Use allowlist/blocklist instead of whitelist/blacklist.

Use primary/secondary instead of master/slave.

Use "refer to" instead of "see", "consult", "check out", and other phrases.

## Formatting

Use sentence case for titles and headings, for example:

- This is sentence case (correct)
- This is Title Case (wrong)

Use the exact page or section title for link text.

Use inline Markdown links, for example, [Link text](https://example.com).

When linking to other sections within the same document,
use a descriptive phrase that includes the section name,
and a relative link to its heading anchor.
For example, "For further details on setup, refer to the [Installation](#installation) section."

Never remove links from copy unless specifically asked to.
If you edit content that includes a link,
always include the link in the edited version, for example:

- It is [here](https://grafana.com) go check it out for details (before)
- Refer to the [Grafana homepage](https://grafana.com) for details (after)

Use two asterisks to bold text, for example `**bold**`.

Use one underscore to emphasize copy, for example `_italics_`.

For UI elements and product features that aren't product names,
use sentence case as they appear in the UI, for example:

- Click **Submit**. (If "Submit" is the exact text on the button)
- Navigate to the **User settings** page. (If "User settings" is the title/label)
- Configure the **alerting rules**. (General concept)
- Open **Explore** in Grafana. (If "Explore" is the branded name of that section)

Avoid using words created for UI features when possible, for example

- In your Grafana Cloud stack, click **Connections**. (correct)
- In your Grafana Cloud stack, click the **Connections** button. (wrong)

## Lists

Write complete sentences for lists, for example:

- Works with all languages and frameworks (correct)
- all languages and frameworks (wrong)

Always use dashes for unordered lists, for example

```markdown
- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3
```

Never use asterisks for unordered lists, for example:

```markdown
* List item 1 (wrong)
* List item 2 (wrong)
* List item 3 (wrong)
```

Never use full stops at the end of unordered list items, for example:

```markdown
- Works with all languages and frameworks (correct)
- Works with all languages and frameworks (wrong)
```

Always start every ordered list item with 1, for example:

```markdown
1. Ordered list item 1.
1. Ordered list item 2.
1. Ordered list item 3.
```

Never increment the numbers for ordered list items, for example:

```markdown
1. Ordered list item 1. (wrong)
2. Ordered list item 2. (wrong)
3. Ordered list item 3. (wrong)
```

Always start the next list item immediately on the next line, for example:

```markdown
- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3
```

Never use new lines between list items, for example:

```markdown
- List item 1

- List item 2 (wrong)

- List item 3 (wrong)
```

If a list starts with a keyword, bold the keyword and follow with a colon,
for example:

```markdown
- **Keyword 1**: list item 1
- **Keyword 2**: list item 2
- **Keyword 3**: list item 3
```

## Images

Always include descriptive alt text for images.
The alt text should convey the essential information or purpose of the image.
Avoid redundant phrases like "Image of..." or "Picture of...".

For example:

- Instead of `![Diagram of system](diagram.png)`
- Use `![Architecture diagram showing data flow from client applications, through a load balancer, to backend services.](architecture-data-flow.png)`

## Code

Use single code backticks for:

- user input
- placeholders in markdown, for example _`<PLACEHOLDER_NAME>`_
- files and directories, for example `/opt/file.md`
- source code keywords and identifiers,
  for example variables, function and class names
- configuration options and values, for example `PORT` and `80`
- status codes, for example `404`

Use triple code backticks followed by the syntax for code blocks, for example:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

Always introduce each code blocks with a short description.
End the introduction with a colon if the code sample follows it, for example:

```markdown
The code sample outputs "Hello World!" to the browser console:

<CODE_BLOCK>
```

Use descriptive placeholder names in code samples.
Use uppercase letters with underscores to separate words in placeholders,
for example:

```sh
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.name=<SERVICE_NAME>
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<OTLP_ENDPOINT>
```

The placeholder includes the name and the less than and greater than symbols,
for example <PLACEHOLDER_NAME>.

If the placeholder is markdown emphasize it with underscores,
for example _`<PLACEHOLDER_NAME>`_.

In code blocks use the placeholder without additional backticks or emphasis,
for example <PLACEHOLDER_NAME>.

Always provide an explanation for each placeholder,
typically in the text following the code block or in a configuration table.

Never add new code block unless specifically asked to, for example,
when asked to improve an article don't add new code.

Never change existing code blocks unless specifically asked to, for example
when asked to improve an article don't edit code.

Always follow code samples with an explanation
and configuration options for placeholders, for example:

```markdown
<CODE_BLOCK>

This code sets required environment variables
to send OTLP data to an OTLP endpoint.
To configure the code for your needs,
refer to the configuration table
and select the appropriate configuration options for your use case.

<CONFIGURATION_TABLE>
```

Never put configuration for a code block before the code block.

## APIs

When documenting API endpoints specify the HTTP method,
for example `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.

Provide the full request path, using backticks.

Use backticks for parameter names and example values.

Use placeholders like `{userId}` for path parameters, for example:

- To retrieve user details, make a `GET` request to `/api/v1/users/{userId}`.

Use a configuration table to describe query and header parameters,
and request body fields.

## CLI commands

When presenting CLI commands and their output,
introduce the command with a brief explanation of its purpose.
Clearly distinguish the command from its output.

For commands, use `sh` to specify the code block language.

For output, use a generic specifier like `text`, `console`,
or `json`/`yaml` if the output is structured.

For example:

````markdown
To list all running pods in the `default` namespace, use the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods --namespace default
```
````

The output will resemble the following:

```text
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-app-deployment-7fdb6c5f65-abcde   1/1     Running   0          2d1h
another-service-pod-xyz123           2/2     Running   0          5h30m
```

## Configuration table

Use Markdown tables to document configuration, including:

- placeholders
- parameters
- YAML/JSON configuration
- environment variables

Add columns for "Option", "Summary", "Required", "Type", "Values", "Default"
in that order.

Use the following values for option:

- YAML/JSON, code, or parameter field if one exists for that configuration
- Environment variable field if one exists for that configuration
- If there is a YAML and Environment variable option separate them with `<br>`

Use a short sentence for the summary.
After the summary sentence and in the same cell,
link to further details using the following format,
"Refer to [option](#option-anchor) for details."

In the values column, describe acceptable values
and include value options or ranges if they exist.
Don't include example values in the table.

An example configuration table:

```markdown
| Option                         | Summary                                                                                              | Required | Type   | Values                               | Default |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `SERVICE_NAME`                 | The logical name of your application or service. Refer to [service name](#service-name) for details. | Yes      | String | A descriptive name for your service. | N/A     |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`  | The target URL for the OTLP exporter. Refer to [OTLP endpoint](#otlp-endpoint) for details.          | Yes      | String | A valid URL.                         | N/A     |
| `logging.level`<br>`LOG_LEVEL` | Sets the logging verbosity. Refer to [logging level](#logging-level) for details.                    | No       | String | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`     | `info`  |
```

In some ocassions, you can drop the Values column, for example,
when all the configuration have a Boolean type (yes/no) or (1/0).

After the table, for each configuration, add a sub-section.

For each sub-section include a heading and more detailed information including:

- a full description
- an explanation of concepts
- any related configuration
- example values with explanations, don't use code blocks only single backticks
  for example values

Use sentence case for the heading and only capitalize known keywords.

Example configuration sub-sections:

```markdown
<CONFIGURATION_TABLE>

### Service name

The `SERVICE_NAME` option specifies the name of your application or service.
This name identifies your service in Grafana Cloud.
It helps filter and query telemetry data.
A name that describes the service helps organize your observability data.

For example, if your microservice handles payments, a service name could be `payment-service`.
If your application is a frontend, you might use `webapp-frontend`.

### OTLP endpoint

The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` option defines the target URL.
The OpenTelemetry (OTLP) exporter sends your telemetry data to this URL.
This endpoint is the ingestion point for your metrics, logs, traces, and profiles.
For Grafana Cloud, this is your Grafana Cloud OTLP endpoint.

An example OTLP endpoint URL is `https://otlp-gateway-prod-us-central-0.grafana.net/otlp`.
Your endpoint URL depends on your Grafana Cloud stack and region.
You find this URL in your Grafana Cloud account details.

### Logging level

The `logging.level` and `LOG_LEVEL` options control the verbosity of logging output.
Use these options to adjust the level of detail in logs for debugging or monitoring purposes.

The available levels are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`.
For example, setting the level to `debug` provides detailed logs useful for troubleshooting,
while `error` limits logs to critical issues.

The default logging level is `info`, which provides a balance between verbosity and relevance.
```

## Comparison table

Use a comparison table when users have multiple options to achieve similar
outcomes and need to understand the trade-offs or key differences between them.

Comparison tables help users make informed decisions by highlighting distinct features,
requirements, or characteristics of each option side-by-side.

Structure the table with options as rows and differentiating criteria as columns.
Ensure each cell provides concise, directly comparable information.

An example comparison table:

```markdown
| Method                      | Code changes             | Language support   | Use case                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grafana OpenTelemetry Java  | Not required (JVM agent) | Java               | Offers advanced instrumentation features and Grafana support. |
| Grafana OpenTelemetry .NET  | Required                 | .NET               | Offers advanced instrumentation features and Grafana support. |
| Upstream OpenTelemetry SDKs | Required                 | Multiple languages | Provides standard instrumentation with community support.     |
```

## Shortcodes

Don't use blockquotes for notes, cautions, or warnings.

Use the custom admonition Hugo shortcode
with <TYPE> as "note", "caution", or "warning":

```markdown
{{< admonition type="<TYPE>" >}}
...
{{< /admonition >}}
```

Use admonitions sparingly.
Only include exceptional information in admonitions,
this means you will use it more often for warnings than notes and cautions.

Never delete Hugo shortcodes unless specifically asked to,
for example don't delete shortcodes:

```markdown
{{< docs/shared source="tempo" lookup="grafana-cloud.md" version="" >}}
```
